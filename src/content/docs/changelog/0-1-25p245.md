# Changelog

## New features, options and improvements

*   Grass FX for new procedural grass (still WIP though, far from good);
*   Particles FX: sparks reworked, new particles for pieces and marbles, a few fixes for smoke and dust;
*   Smart Shadows: adaptive distances for better distant shadows with Extra FX;
*   Extra FX:
    *   New approach for bounced lights, quite fast;
    *   Screen-space lights (for now, only sparks);
*   New IMGUI-based apps (very WIP, more to come later);
*   Python apps: include icons in main app folder by naming them as `app.png` or `<form name>.png`:
    *   Make it a simple icon without circle or background, patch would turn it into regular style icon;
*   Vertex shadows for trees (at least as a temporary fix);
*   Proper alpha-to-coverage for grass, trees and ksPerPixelAT (no more banding, instead, it's used for anti-aliasing as it should be);
*   Specular lighting is affected by Lambert diffuse multiplier to get rid of wrong speculars;
*   New ksPerPixel_ppfog shader: simplest ksPerPixel, but with per-pixel fog, for tracks with some huge triangles (better to not do that though);
*   New biased double face shadow option for track meshes;
*   Option for alternative flip model initialization, improving performance a bit;
*   Improved auto-focus with Ctrl+Click, now working without photomode as well;
    *   Use Ctrl+End to deactivate depth of field effect;
*   New taskbar: option for new icons style;
*   Align free camera vertically by pressing Ctrl+F7;
*   Car instrument inputs:
    *   Set pivot for min/max mode, allowing to pick value the most or the least different from the pivot;
    *   New input: `POSITION`, for race position;
    *   New `INPUT_THRESHOLD_LOWER`/`INPUT_THRESHOLD_UPPER` options;
*   Cornering lights now would only work with headlights enabled;
*   Fixes;
