## New features, options and improvements

*   New smoke:
    *   Look, shape and behaviour adjusted;
    *   Shadows and ambient shadows reworked a bit;
    *   Additional smoke-car collision check based on collision box rather than sphere;
    *   Exhaust smoke;
    *   Smoke from flames;
    *   Smoke from the engine if damaged;
    *   Smoke from overheated brake discs (all of that might need adjustments);
*   New input for track conditions: `SPECTATORS` (1 or smaller if amount of spectators is reduced);
*   New option for additional track audio events: `BOUND_TO_SPECTATORS`;
*   New `TRANSPARENT_AS_BLACK` blend mode: no blending, but transparent areas are drawn as black (for fixing existing models via configs; like Ruf Yellowbird);
*   Major update for PBR shaders, mainly thanks to docs for Filament by Google:
    *   New and updated PBR textures;
    *   Improved PBR textures application;
    *   Metalness taken from alpha-channel of txDetail;
    *   Improved energy conservation;
    *   Fixed overly intense reflections;
    *   Separate PBR cloth shader with sheen and subsurface color;
    *   Simplified and more accurate clear coat;
    *   Improved interaction with dynamic lights and vertex AO application;
    *   Fix for blending normals;
    *   Fix for DXT1/5 artifacts on gray textures;
    *   Option to blur out txDetail to only use color, not pattern (and use pattern from PBR textures);
*   Interior masking mapping and brightness fixed;
*   Object Inspector app updated:
    *   New layout;
    *   Scrolling, sorting and filtering for material properties;
    *   Copyable areas instead of copy buttons;
    *   Texture viewer helping with setting up custom emissive areas;
*   Pushing force of extended tracing for tyres now uses a bit better formula;
*   Wipers animation works on cars other than focused;
*   Default wear speed for both Brake Disc FX and Tyres FX slowed down;
*   Temporal antialiasing making windscreens blurry from inside fixed;
*   SSLR being way too greedy fixed, now interior view on wet track should be more reasonable;
*   Grass FX:
    *   Lazier updating to slightly improve performance;
    *   Ambient shadows from cars fixed;
*   Refracting headlights mark surface as non-transparent and work with forced reflections for inside meshes;
*   Line light: diffuse concentration option works;
*   Car animations now work in distance;
*   Stencil for TAA improved, making it work per-object rather than per-material, should reduce TAA artifacts in interiors;
*   Improved light positioning for license plate lights (new parameters, `MESH_FILTER_DIRECTION` and `MESH_FILTER_OFFSET`);
*   Speculars for all shaders now reduce with grazing angles to get rid of certain artifacts;
*   New `NormalizeAO` parameter for car paints, set to 1 to improve the way AO from txDiffuse is applied (mainly for cars with AO in txDiffuse);
*   New `CustomEmissive_AreaMask` template for using four areas as a mask;
*   Few small optimizations and fixes.
