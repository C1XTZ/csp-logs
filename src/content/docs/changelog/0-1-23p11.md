## New features, options and improvements

*   Black areas fixed (hopefully);
*   Configs adjusted;
*   Track lights:
    *   Clusterization fixed;
        *   Please, set `SPOT_SHARPNESS` to 1 to test if it's not too low, and lights are not getting doubled.
    *   New value for `DIRECTION` for `LIGHT_SERIES`: `NORMAL`, to use averaged normals (look at `forliring.ini` for example).
    *   A couple of new configs by atrip3 and RealAKP, slightly altered for updated patch.
