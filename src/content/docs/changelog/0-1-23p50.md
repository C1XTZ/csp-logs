## New features, options and improvements

*   No more accumulation AA screenshots for VR and triple-screen mode (would require more trickery, I'll add that later);
*   Screenshots saving in JPG format fixed;
*   Specific changes in grass and trees shader, to adapt their lighting, rolled back, since it appears that sometimes those shaders are getting used for other purposes (I'll find a better approach later).
