# Changelog

## New features, options and improvements

*   Now, if AC would crash, crash dump would be created! Makes debugging so much easier, so, please, include them as well (should be generated in logs folder);
*   Weather FX: shared materials for clouds, rare second frame crash fixed, accurate sun, moon, stars and planets movements, new fog implementation (WIP), clouds rendering optimized, shadows can be disabled by weather;
*   Neck: deadzone and linearity for controller, Track IR support (so now it's compatible with RHM as well), fix for occasional black screen;
*   Replays saving fixed, now AC won't damage other files (very sorry about this one in particular);
*   New Chat Shortcuts extension (press `~` to see the messages; options for control bindings are coming soon);
*   New layouts for license plate lights: `TWO_ON_BOTTOM` and `ONE_ON_BOTTOM`;
*   New options for animated turning lights: `SMOOTH_IN` (0 or 1, default value is 1) and `SMOOTH_OUT` (default value is 0) to match real life turning lights;
*   Fuel needle fixed;
*   Trees VAO can be turned off and on again.
