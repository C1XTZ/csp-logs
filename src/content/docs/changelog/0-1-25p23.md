## New features, options and improvements

*   Brake Disc FX fixed;
*   Now compatible with AC shadows removal patch;
*   But, at the same time, it's now included here as well: in other words, if your shadows are set to Off in CM, even without that shadows removal patch, shadows will be gone now;
*   Auto guessing for visually adjustable wings;
*   New feature for cars: wobbly bits;
*   Neck: 
    *   Track IR fixed;
    *   Fast G-forces response deactivated (after some consideration, I decided it was a bad idea to add it in the first place);
*   Animated turning lights fixed;
*   New options for turning lights: `REPEAT_FREQENCY_HAZARDS_HZ` (separate frequency for hazards), `USE_RANGE_FOR_HAZARDS` (set to 0 to disable animation in hazards mode);
*   Other small fixes.
