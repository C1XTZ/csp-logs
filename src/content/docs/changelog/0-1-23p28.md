# Changelog

## New features, options and improvements

• Custom emissive management now enabled by default;
• New `car_instruments.ini`, everything related to extra lights and that is moved to a separate optional module;
• Breakable lights reworked, now they flick rarely, and for a very limited time;
• Dynamic odometers (optional; at the moment, with configs just for E30 and Yellowbird; for now, total distance is loaded from Stereo Odometer app);
• Option for correct speedometer (with speed taken from the gearbox);
• Bugfixes and small improvements.
