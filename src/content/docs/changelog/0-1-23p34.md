*   Various bugfixes;
*   Custom emissive management fixed;
*   Lights binding to emissives fixed in cases like with pit lights;
*   Odometers: maximum value (`UPPER_BOUND`, to nicely wrap to 0 for analog and stick with 999… for digital), format option to digital (look in Transit's config, `DIGITAL_ITEM_NUMBER_FORMAT`), loading value from Sidekick database;
*   Python function to reset car to the track or go 300 meters back (only works offline in single car sessions, invalidates laps);
*   Option to hide wrong way indicator and resetting (offline, in track day or practice sessions, optional);
