*   Mirrors fixed;
*   Particles FX:
    *   Dust for new smoke (WIP);
    *   New smoke behavior fixed;
    *   Optional brightness multiplies for different states for traces;
    *   Option to set emitting position for traces;
*   `SHADER_REPLACEMENT_…`:
    *   Alter shader properties relatively to original values (increasing by X or in X times);
    *   Skinned meshes now available to alter as well;
*   Vertex AO:
    *   Support for cars & drivers positioned in cars;
    *   Now affects reflections, after being scaled;
    *   Patches can contain `SHADER_REPLACEMENT_…` sections, allowing to increase `ksAmbient` where necessary;
    *   Option for gamma;
    *   AO splitting, for smooth transitions;
    *   Alternative AO set (for driver shadows);
    *   Extra AO samples for fast and reliable ambient occlusion for dynamic objects;
    *   Slow loading is fixed;
*   Splitting meshes to elements optimized (preparing distant emissives for Le Mans now take 0.02 s instead of 5.2 s);
*   Weather FX:
    *   API to access track config;
    *   Improved clouds light dimming;
*   Vertex AO and SSAO/HBAO+ support for stPerPixelMultiMap_specular shader;
*   New MultiMap-based shader for digital screen with masking;
*   Better blending for distant emissives;
*   New Python functions for free camera: `ac.ext_setCameraPosition()` and `ac.ext_setCameraDirection()`;
*   Instruments fixed;
*   Siren mode working with gamepads;
*   Disabled shadows in VR fixed;
*   New sets of shaders for disabled shadows, using VAO for diffuse shadows;
*   SSGI is now applied as light source rather than as post-processing effect;
*   Freer Camera:
    *   Recond and restore positions with optional smoothness (lag);
    *   Optionally, record and restore replay position as well;
*   More small fixes.
