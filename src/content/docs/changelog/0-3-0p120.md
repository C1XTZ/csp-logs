# Changelog

## New features, options and improvements

*   Crash related to asynchonous textures, happening sometimes with Scene API (in particular, on SRP servers), should be fixed;
*   Missing leaderboard, ping, starting lights and wrong way indicator are fixed;
*   Fixed compatibility with some of additional DLL plugins (usually, causing those `Integrity-failure` messages on top in offline races);
*   Render stats: latency counter in GPU details;
*   F6 camera incorrecly detected interior/exterior state fixed;
*   Cars physics threadpool, as well as other threadpools, should operate a bit faster;
*   Lua: new `shared/utils/openkneeboard` library for sending commands to OpenKneeboard;
*   Option hiding driver in VR and leaving only gloves now can be applied to non-VR modes as well;
*   New small tweak un-hiding steering wheel and driver in VR;
*   New setting disabling Microsoft Media Foundation (used for video and, occasionally, audio players) entirely (mostly, to save a bit of FPS in some specific cases);
*   New setting disabling track displays (the ones without scripts) entirely (also to save a bit of FPS, just in case);
*   Virtual mirrors not getting proper post-processing applied in some cases with default Weather FX style fixed;
*   Render stats: other threads are measured only if viewed, keep being measured if main window is collapsed but `Other threads` window is opened;
*   Exhaust flames fixed (plus, a couple of mechanisms to untie particles from audio if audio is missing or broken);
*   Smoke particles use VAO at the spawn point;
*   Smoke ambient shadows are no longer overly dark with LCS, a mechanism keeping track of nearby smoke density used for optimizations improved;
*   Smoke receives shadows (fourth cascade) in mirrors;
*   Names for measures of other threads slightly cleaned up, measures are sorted alphabetically;
*   New menu: crash in setup with some types of items fixed;
*   Fake shadows and other things missing in mirrors fixed;
*   Textures missing in some specific cases are fixed.
