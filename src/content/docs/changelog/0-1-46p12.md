## New features, options and improvements

*   I reworked Smart Shadows part, adding an option for custom shadow matrices. They should be more stable, so shadows wouldn't jiggle around as much with camera rotation, and take into account corners of triple screen cameras or VR orientation properly. Stabilization is pretty simple, but this way, it doesn't require sacrificing pixels-to-meters ratio.
