# Changelog

## New features, options and improvements

*   New threadpool implementation for cars physics should reduce late frame;
*   Main physics thread rewritten to prevent late frames as well;
*   New physics experiments (disabled by default): modern timing for render and physics threads (should reduce CPU consumption and help with performance overall, requires Windows 10 version 1803 or newer);
*   Physics thread performance computation updated to be more informative and precise;
*   New KN5 loader: shader name is accounted for when sharing materials across cars and LODs (fixes the issue with Caterham);
*   Effect of wind on puddles improved and readjusted, few other visual tweaks;
*   Disabling chunks optimizer no longer messes up some tracks;
*   Grass FX: fixes for shadows and culling in triple screen mode;
*   Wind audio is tuned back, now a bit more quiet unless exterior audio component is being mixed in (for example, with an open door);
*   F5 camera no longer considers nearest car as focused and instead uses the actual focused car (fixes issues with wind audio and more);
*   Custom FSR scale shouldn't lead to a crash anymore;
*   Refracting headlights failing to initialize properly are fixed, caching no longer occurs for entries with dynamic maps (please don't use them though);
*   New audio-driven flames are better compatible with wild flame configs with intensities above 1;
*   Option to disable navigators is back until I figure out how to make them faster;
*   Mouse cursor no longer hides if it's hovering an IMGUI window;
*   Tyres with `CAMBER_GAIN=0` should be less prone to exploding the simulation;
*   Aligned car positioning adjusted to better handle cars with different wheel radii, and just be more reasonable in general;
*   New menu: margin for window titles fixed, extra setup items in tyres section use full logic for different types;
*   Bounding spheres for skinned and digital LEDs merging, as well as a few other optimizations, are enabled and hidden;
*   Caching CSP configs is enabled by default, now cached configs store the list of all the referenced files and force reprocessing if any of referenced files have changed;
*   SIMD-accelerated culling for tracks enabled by default;
*   `Alter ambience audio` option enabled by default;
*   Async loading of config textures is enabled by default (seems like this was an overkill, and black textures should be fixed now, but if not, please DM me your settings, the track you're using and if you're using any custom skins or configs for it);
*   Double-sided track shadows option is disabled and hidden (it wasn't really needed and was breaking some good tracks);
*   Extra reverb pauses on camera jumps to prevent auditory artifacts;
*   Reflections FX: new experimental option to position reflection cubemap at the ground (experimental & broking things);
*   New experimental small tweak, showing driver names on license plates in online races;
*   New small tweak force enabling free camera (enabled by default);
*   CSP Debug: `View in Explorer…` in context menu for saved states;
*   Multithread performance measures no longer go wild if the same function is being called from different threads in parallel;
*   New `KEEP_ON_RESET` flag for extra switches stopping them from being reset with car teleports;
*   New hidden section in `general.ini`, `QOS_TWEAKS`, for setting TOS flag for UDP traffic using a couple of different methods (just for a test, everything is disabled by default);
*   Lua: `math.nan` fixed, general handling of NaN-related stuff improved, including logging;
*   Crashes with Weather FX styles using `asyncUpdate()` on reload fixed;
*   Problems with error handling in C++→Lua→C++→Lua calls fixed;
*   PP filter selector app no longer appears in VR unless that experimental tweak is enabled;
*   New `physics.Collider.Ray()`;
*   New `ui.DWriteFont(…):spacing()` allowing to adjust spacing between characters;
*   Custom DWrite fonts no longer crash when pointing to a non-existent directory;
*   Passing `math.huge` as MIPs counter to `ui.ExtraCanvas` works;
*   If `ui.ExtraCanvas` has been assigned to a scene and then disposed (or GC-ed), scene entity retains the texture and no longer resets to black;
*   New `ac.SceneReference:getTextureSlotDetails()` allowing to get more details about a texture, such as size;
*   New `shared/sim/plates` for generating license plates in Kunos style (currently, requires I/O access and uses assets from Content Manager);
*   Passing `nil` as direction to `physics.setAICarPosition()` aligns car along the spline direction;
*   Teleporting AI using physics API resets its time-to-start parameter to 0;
*   New `physics.setAITimeToStart()` overriding time-to-start of AIs;
*   New `.combineAxes` field for `ac.CarControlsInput` allowing to override values instead of combining them;
*   Few hidden experimental QOS tweaks in `general.ini` for UDP traffic.
