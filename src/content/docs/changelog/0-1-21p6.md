## New features, options and improvements

*   New option to only have full range for first person view, enabled by default;
*   Setup bounding sphere or interior range per car;
*   Settings per car for how much car is lit, or settings for interior shadows;
  Honda NSX looks better now.
*   I found a way to switch between shaders in real-time, so now performance with tyres might improve, and that bug in replays should be solved.
