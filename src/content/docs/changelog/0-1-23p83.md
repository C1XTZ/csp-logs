## New features, options and improvements

*   Major bug fixed (comparing to preview82);
*   Tyres FX: damages accumulation fixed;
*   Real mirror: fixes for rendering, role guessing and HQ compatibility;
*   `INCLUDE` behavior is fixed (now, `INLUDE` in included files also works, that's why ACFL F1 cars were acting wrongly);
*   Loading screen: option to fallback to some graphics instead of AC logo, for now those dots backgrounds are used;
*   Loading screen: extra car specs;
*   Lights limits fixed;
*   Track lights: rare flashing bug fixed;
*   Graphics adjustments: optional color grading, same as in Custom Showroom (for now, doesn't work without FXAA/SMAA or in screenshots, very experimental; both DDS and PNG formats are supported);
*   New Brake Disc FX: some sort of rim reflections, dynamic heating color;
*   Brake disc lights fixed;
*   Ambient shadows for wheels in wheel arches;
*   Brighter tyres in cloudy weather;
*   New `ac.ext_getTyreVirtualKM(car, tyre)` function;
*   Fixed `ac.ext_version()`;
*   Spamming with curve messages in `log.txt` fixed;
*   Attempt to fix `PythonInterface.printErr` error, might not work right now;
*   Rare bug causing AC to crash with mesh replacements (for example, with patched Yellowbird from here: [https://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/ruf-ctr-yellowbird-visual-update.21343/](https://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/ruf-ctr-yellowbird-visual-update.21343/)) fixed;
*   For cars, `LIGHT_SWITCH_DELAY` now has `LIGHT_SWITCH_LAG` alternative;
*   Smooth lights switching improved;
*   AI Flood parameters adjusted;
*   Flames lights fixed;
*   Spotlights can have angle higher than 180°, for special lamppost;
*   New `AFFECTS_TRACK` parameter for car lights;
*   New `MESH_ADJUSTMENT` sections for tracks, allowing to change parameters such as `IsTransparent` (looking at those wet track mods which lose car ambient shadows);
*   Configs for Caterhams, thanks to benobro.
