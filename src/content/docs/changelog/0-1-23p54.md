# Changelog

## New features, options and improvements

*   Real Mirror fixes and improvements;
*   Flashes fixed;
*   Virtual mirror fixed;
*   New graphics adjustment extension, allowing to increase motion blur amount (later, there might be more);
*   Separate `TRACK_AMBIENT_GROUND_MULT_VAO` parameter for tracks with baked vertex AO, plus option to re-define it in tracks' configs;
*   Accumulation AA for screenshots:
    *   Windows Imaging Component for encoding, to improve JPEG quality;
    *   Option to set JPEG quality;
    *   Three monitors support;
    *   Option to disable FXAA to keep screenshots sharp;
    *   Motion blur support, plus option to make it smoother;
    *   DOF fix (pretty bad, but it's better than nothing);
    *   Saving time decreased.
*   If you want to speed screenshots up a bit, set `SAVE_ORIGINAL` in `nice_screenshots.ini` to 0. Forgot to change that, but with it set to 1, you can compare screenshots, so it might helpful.
*   To limit fps impact of real mirrors you can set `RENDER_PER_FRAME` in `REAL_MIRRORS` section of `smart_mirror.ini`. `RENDER_PER_FRAME=0` means all mirrors get updated each frame.
