# Changelog

## New features, options and improvements

*   Tyres FX flickering fixed;
*   Loading screen: improved UTF-8 support, proper word wrapping;
*   Lights debugging: display outlines, bounding boxes and spheres (set in blamer's app, or in `lighting_fx.ini`);
*   New `TRACK_CONDITIONS_RESTORE` option in `general.ini`, to stop lights from re-enabling when config is changed;
*   Light tyres rearranged: precision improved, spotlights can have both `DIFFUSE_CONCENTRATION` and non-zero `SPECULAR_MULT`;
*   Line light now can have `COLOR_FROM` and `COLOR_TO` allowing to create gradients or adjust brightness along the line;
*   `SPOT`, `SPOT_SHARPNESS` and `DIRECTION` are also available for line light;
*   And, now it can have speculars too, although they could be slower than spotlight speculars;
*   New Python functions: `ac.ext_version()`, `ac.ext_getTyreGrain(car_index, tyre_index)` (plus `ext_getTyreBlister` and `ext_getTyreFlatSpot`), `ac.ext_pauseFsWatching()`, `ac.ext_resumeFsWatching()`, `ac.ext_debugLights(…)`, `ac.ext_applyTrackConfig(…)` (for example, look at AccExtHelper app);
*   Small fixes.
