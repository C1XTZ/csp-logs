# Changelog

## New features, options and improvements

*   Reflections in cars in rear view mirror fixed once more, now they consider fog color too;
*   Deformable tyres in Tyres FX fixed;
*   Track configs loading fixed (in some specific cases, some lights were ignored);
*   Python `ext_getTrackLightsVisible` function fixed;
*   New `INPUT_STAY_FOR` and `INPUT_CHANGE_DELAY` parameters for conditions, added specially for `RACING_FLAG`;
*   Accumulation screenshots fixed, no more weird glitches;
*   New option for screenshots to increase resolution using the same approach, glitchy with high multipliers and some filters, but might be useful.
