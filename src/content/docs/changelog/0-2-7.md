*   New FFB postprocessing script replacing FFB entirely;
*   New optimizations (experimental, disabled by default):
    *   Postpone optional features to prevent freezes;
    *   Hyperthreading fix (tries to move physics away from rendering cores);
    *   GPU optimization speeding up GPU→CPU data transfer;
*   MoTeC logger: added aero speed and cosmic suspension forces;
*   Drift Challenge updated to 1.1;
*   Physics experiments:
    *   New collision-check logic for single-frame collisions lifespan;
    *   New option for computing physics collisions in parallel with cars physics;
    *   Experiments `Repair wheel joints` and `Fix ground colliders` are upgraded from experiments to finalized always active tweaks, now available online;
*   Graphics Adjustments/LODs:
    *   Experimental option to skip LOD A for secondary cars entirely, disabled by default;
    *   Experimental option to hide wheels for interior views based on TyresFX's `VISIBLE_IN_INTERIOR_CAM` parameter (active for open-wheelers);
*   Smart Shadows:
    *   Option to use anisotropic filtering for tree shadows;
    *   Option to disable sharp interior shadows for first person view for automatic splits;
*   New loading screen:
    *   Options to hide certain components;
    *   Option to use a Lua script to replace the look entirely, with a basic script as an example;
*   New Behavior:
    *   Option to fix upshift threshold for AIs is active by default now (applies to cars with upshift threshold above `limiterThreshold - 100`);
    *   New option to change downshift threshold for AIs (activates by default if upshift threshold has been altered), takes gear ratios into account;
    *   Very experimental AI tweak for some variance and adaptation for AIs trying to get them to be a bit faster when possible;
*   Nice Screenshots:
    *   Option to use actual HDR or estimated HDR for accumulation for actually correct results (actual HDR is not available with resolution multiplier);
    *   Option for preblur image a bit to improve the results of accumulation DOF;
    *   Option for anamorphic DOF (looks like radial blur for bokeh);
    *   Option for color aberration for DOF (only for DOF);
    *   DOF-related options can be adjusted in photo app, including an ability to quickly enable accumulation DOF;
    *   Option to use per-car cubemaps for screenshots for more accurate reflections;
    *   Press `enter` to stop accumulating screenshots and save the result if it looks good enough;
    *   Accumulation DOF without motion blur sorts offsets from smallest to largest leading to DOF increasing with accumulation, but always looking decent;
    *   Accumulative shadows: single slider replaced with separate, adjusted live based on number of iterations, default settings match regular angular diameter of the sun;
    *   Option to add accumulation AA for reflection cubemaps;
*   Default WeatherFX style: sunrays with LCS fixed, changes of seeing falling stars increased a bit;
*   GUI: option to enable apps in pause menu (it'll use a fifth in-game desktop for a specialized apps layout);
*   Original AC `Flash Headlights` binding now flashes regular headlights if car doesn't have dedicated flashing lights;
*   GrassFX shading updated to add more depth and intensity;
*   General: option to explicitly select an internet connection to use for AC (applies to online, `web.` API and Mumble client);
*   Render Stats app: measurements for three core groups (much closer to total frame CPU and GPU time when summed up), measurements hierarchy has been fixed;
*   Warning for Intel Gen13/14 CPUs without updated motherboard firmware during loading (check is done with ChatGPT, can't test it on my hardware, but it might work);
*   Custom VR HUD: experimental options to follow headset;
*   WindscreenFX: option to add reflections to windscreens for exterior views (mostly for the way interior part of glass looks with an open door);
*   Option to clear some of CSP caches on CSP version change (enabled by default);
*   Mumble client: volume sliders are now capped at 200% instead of 100%;
*   Android Auto: browser should be blocking some ads now.

    *   `render.glVertexTextured()` works with LCS;
