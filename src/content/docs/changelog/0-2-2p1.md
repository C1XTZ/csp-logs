# Changelog

## New features, options and improvements

*   Caster and KPI displays for cosmic suspension in setup menu and suspension app;
*   Updated tyre contact points logic;
*   New physics experiment disabling car sleeping outside of pits after starting a race (disabled by default for now);
*   FFB Tweaks:
    *   Option to average skipped FFB samples for more precise feedback;
    *   Option to reduce update rate for damping FFB (since it's only used for low speed FFB damping, it makes sense to update it less often. Can help with 99% cpu warnings at low speeds with some wheel bases);
*   GPU optimizations:
    *   Option to use background BC7 compression for cached CSP textures (such as WeatherFX clouds or billboards of new trees);
    *   Option to use background BC7 compression to re-encode wrongly compressed AC textures so they could load faster and run better on subsequent runs;
*   Graphics Adjustments:
    *   Generate new fallback LOD for all cars using collider mesh;
    *   Limit amount of active LOD As of cars with a single LOD;
    *   Option to render virtual mirror before the scene in single and triple screen mode (might add some small glitches with refraction and ExtraFX, but save a bit of performance);
*   Holding Shift or Alt stops AC system bindings (such as Ctrl+R for replays) allowing to bind extra things to something like Ctrl+Shift+R;
*   Option in car instruments for car headlights to shake a bit;
*   New audio tweak to add reverb to more audio events and increase amount of reverb for non-reverb events a bit;
*   New taskbar update:
    *   Collapsing categories;
    *   Optional streamlined mode going straight to the list of apps;
    *   Optional compact mode;
    *   Scrolling speed increased;
    *   Alt+H shortcut from old CSP taskbar is supported;
*   New built-in audio app replacing original with presets and extra sliders;
*   Original sun trajectory removed, equinox trajectory (20th of March 2023) is used instead, but WeatherFX styles and Lua apps can change the neutral sun trajectory timestamp;
*   Track audio slider moved from Track Adjustments to AC audio settings and affects track Lua scripts as well;
*   Bind car reset and taking a step back to controller buttons;
*   CSP Debug app:
    *   Option to click on a track to teleport to a clicked point (in singleplayer practice sessions);
    *   Saving and loading car state can be bound to controllers working even if the app is closed;
*   Default WeatherFX style:
    *   A bit of pollution haze in clear weather based on light pollution configuration;
    *   Rain audio and other rain-related effects improved;
*   New Traffic race mode (requires configured tracks with `traffic-planner-ready` tag);
*   Walking Out module moved from being a hidden module to a new Quick Drive mode;
*   UI animations are a bit faster, with an option to disable animations entirely;
*   Option for triple screen mode to configure margins per side to shift UI a bit and prevent losing apps outside of visible area, also saves a bit of FPS;
*   Experimental tweak for OpenVR postponing buffer swap that might increase responsiveness;
*   Some of CSP resources are packed inside `dwrite.dll` for things to work more reliably and load a bit faster;
*   Option to stretch accumulation DOF shape horizontally or vertically;
*   Web browser engine updated: few security fixes from OBS CEF repo, FPS is no longer locked at 30 with direct loop mode;
*   Options for windowed VR to capture mouse and force AC window to stay on top, just in case;
*   CSP now supports all the system hotkeys from CM for better responsiveness and proper modifier button logic;
*   Disabling seasons also disables accurate sun trajectory by default (unless it's an online race and server specifies date explicitly);
*   Refueling in pits smoothly increases the amount of fuel shown on a dashboard.

    *   Tool can show actual walls working;
*   Reduce volume a bit and add some reverb to distant audio sources to simulate general occlusion with `[AUDIO_DISTANT_OCCLUSION] DISTANCE=… FADING=…` (already set by default for Kunos tracks in generic config);
*   Add reverb to audio events located in reverb areas even if camera is outside of reverb areas with `[AUDIO_DISTANT_OCCLUSION] REVERB_CONTRIBUTION=…` (also configured for Kunos tracks);
*   Occasional misbehavior and crashes happening when editing car lights and emissives fixed;
*   Colliders can be configured using stiffness and damping instead of CFM/ERP, or even with curves for values depending on depth. Can be used for cars with sprung bottom planks (e.g. LMP2) or to just have more control over ground collisions. Documentation to be added to wiki;
