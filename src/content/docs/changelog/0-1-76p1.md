# Changelog

## New features, options and improvements

*   AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution integration (works with either PP and FXAA enabled in AC video settings, or in VR mode with any configuration);
*   FXAA replacement options in Graphics Adjustments now apply to VR as well;
*   Option to save last 30 seconds of replay as a small clip with a shortcut (servers can also set an upload URL for those for more automated reporting);
*   Mumble integration for voice chat with positional audio with option to adjust scale in server configuration;
*   New way to animate wipers of most shapes and forms, doesn't need to split meshes, automatically snaps them onto windscreen and more;
*   New Colorized Shadowing module for windscreen banners to cast colorful shadows and colorize ambient lighting nearby;
*   Interior reflections masking reworked, now applied to all nearby cars;
*   A bit of occlusion for driver model for enclosed cars, similar to Shadowed Wheels module;
*   With free camera, nearest car within 10 meters now counts as focused;
*   `Limit audio` option updated, now with proper fading and further optimizing;
*   Caching for precomputed CSP data (such as new fake shadows for cars) reworked, old entries will be removed automatically;
*   NeckFX: option for horizon lock to lock camera to track surface instead of horizon;
*   New module with tweaks for triple screen mode, allows to alter how image is split between three cameras;
*   Default normals textures for spectators redrawn properly, with updated shading;
*   Ghost car recorder saves its file immediately after a new record instead of waiting for session to end;
*   Digital displays for mirrors now optional, with an option for better LDR simulation;
*   Default WeatherFX implementation updated, with adjusted lighting and clouds, AIs now turn on headlights in time as well;
*   Option for simpler render style of new UI, to speed things up a bit for simpler GPUs;
*   Speculars in reflection cubemap are disabled to reduce flickering;
*   Debug mode for Origin Shift is removed to prevent people from activating it accidentally.

## Fixes

*   Fake track shadows added in 0.1.74 now can be linked to meshes to disappear on certain layouts where meshes are missing;
*   Flying wipers on LODs of some cars and similar issues where animation breaks when applied to LOD are fixed;
*   Caching AC data to speed up loading breaking car skins fixed;
*   Cars with VAO looking too dark until VAO is switched a few times fixed;
*   Few performance issues related to IBL reflections fixed;
*   VAO gamma now applies to VAO samples affecting car brightness as well;
*   Driver Interview mode fixed (winning condition was missing), difficulty reduced, now working with track from assettocorsamods.net as well;
*   Digital screens shader updated for more accurate TN color distortion;
*   Boosted edge refraction for sides of glass is fixed;
*   Cars falling through ground on some rare tracks fixed (bug in 0.1.74);
*   After making an accumulation blur store, state of particles will be restored;
*   URLs in welcome message: parsing fixed, support for TeamSpeak and Mumble URLs, context menu to copy URL to clipboard;
*   Custom clip planes from Graphics Adjustments now apply with VR mode selected unless camera is inside a car;
*   AI flood: disabling colour randomization now works;
*   CPU cars heightmap used for detecting where the camera is fixed;
*   Origin Shift works with post-processing disabled;
*   Sped up reflections now work properly, no longer breaking on some tracks;
*   WeatherFX: occlusion estimation fixed, clipped clouds fixed;
*   TAA for refracting headlights fixed;
*   Default normals textures for spectators only apply to default spectators textures;
*   Horizon object detection improved to fix background glitch on some tracks;
*   Issue with things getting blurred on LODs switching fixed;
*   Virtual mirror breaking UI in certain combination of settings fixed;
*   Displays with cameras on tracks work with origin shift and show smoke, flames and fireworks;
*   Visual oil spills getting stuck fixed;
*   Crashes on exit fixed;
*   Speculars from dynamic lights on car paint shader fixed;
*   Few smaller fixes and optimizations.

## Configs

*   Human surface material now can be set in car config;
*   GrassFX: option to adjust texture brightness in track config (for colored parts);
    *   Variations of Highlands textures are removed to save space, instead for compatibility CSP will use a brightness adjustment for them;
*   Apps for track conditions and track occluders are removed;
*   Instead, they're added as tools in Objects Inspector to stop cluttering apps list, more apps will be moved and added soon;
*   Fake track shadows tool is reworked, now it can link shadows to meshes and manage all the shadows at once;
*   Default specular multiplier for track lights is changed to 1 now (with tracks generic config);
*   New way to create digital instruments, displays `[SCRIPTABLE_DISPLAY_...]` scriptable with Lua;
*   New addition for cars, `[EXTRA_SHAPE_...]` allowing to create new geometry (for example, for Kunos cars missing some indicators or properly mapped displays);
*   New templates for easy creation of new displays and indicators with `[EXTRA_SHAPE...]`;
*   New `RESOLUTION_LIMIT` option for dynamic textures, to make sure unusually set scaling wouldn't make them too big;
*   New mode for digital screen material, VA matrix;
*   Navigators now can use car textures as loading logos (look at BMW M4 config for an example);
*   All other references to textures (in `[SHADER_REPLACEMENT_...]`, for example, can use car textures too;
*   Parameter `ALPHA_MODE` for features using bending shader now applied correctly;
*   INIpp:
    *   Macros in templates now can't override values set by macros in main section;
    *   New `@GENERATOR_STARTING_INDEX` parameter for templates used in generators to change staring index;
*   `[PARTICLES_FX_EXHAUST_...]`: direction is now optional, oriented backwards by default;
*   `[MESH_ADJUSTMENT_...]` and `[NODE_ADJUSTMENT_...]` updated:
    *   Now work the same for tracks and cars;
    *   Moving meshes to different nodes updates their vertices so they would be positioned in the same place, great to get mesh coordinates to match car coordinates;
*   `SKINS` filter now can use complex queries such as `SKINS = '{ ( red?, green? ) & !?_matte }'`;
*   Visualize pits for currently active cars (loaded and not disconnected):
    *   Toggle garage doors or animate them;
    *   New track condition inputs to check if corresponding cars are present;
*   Split track mesh elements into separate meshes (increases number of draw calls, use carefully);
*   Shader `stPerPixelNM_UVflow`:
    *   Parameters for UV multiplier and offset (bind offset to an animated condition for transition effect);
    *   Parameter to use alpha-channel from txDiffuse instead of txNormal;
    *   Parameter to clip out everything outside of 0…1 texture coordinates;
*   Hex colors in material adjustments now work;
*   Digital displays for mirrors: option to adjust the angle;
*   Wrongly set `OUT` values in lods.ini now fixed automatically to match `IN` of a following definition;
*   Masking pass now works with delayed render (great for colorful windscreen banners);
*   New interior cars material `[Material_WindscreenBanner]` with everything for windscreen banners, frames and so on for easy colored shadowing and RainFX integration.

## Lua & Python

*   Structures with state extended, containing a lot more data now;
*   Lua API generator rewritten, now ensures type safety and adds automatic conversions where possible;
*   Few fixes for Lua API (now vectors only equal to vectors and such);
*   WeatherFX:
    *   New `ac.setCameraOcclusionDepthBoost()` value to adjust cubemap-based occlusion estimation;
    *   New cloud material property `.alphaSmoothTransition` for adjusting alpha gradient;
    *   Cloud properly `.extraFidelity` can be set below zero to blur pattern instead of adding an extra layer;
*   New modes:
    *   API to draw UI moved from `ac.ui…` to `ui.…` (sorry about this, I usually try not to break compatibility, but it's just been released and I think it's better to fix this one sooner);
    *   API to draw things in 3D-space;
*   Automatically generated definitions now include types.
