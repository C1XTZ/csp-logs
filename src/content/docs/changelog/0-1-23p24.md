## New features, options and improvements

*   Introducing conditions: bind your lights to activate only for a specific time of day, with LUTs;
*   Conditions might also have `LAG` and `SIMULATE_HEATING `properties, allowing for lights to turn on and off smoothly, with a bit of a gradient in the process;
*   Alter material properties! On per-material or per-object basis, either in a static manner, or bound to conditions. For examples, look at Brands Hatch config;
*   New properties to alter `DIRECTION=NORMAL` value:
    *   `DIRECTION_ALTER` allows to set a vector in normal basis, so, for example, `DIRECTION_ALTER=0,0,1` would mean no adjustment at all, `DIRECTION_ALTER=1,0,0` would mean vector is turned 90° to the left (or right, don't remember right now), and `DIRECTION_ALTER=0,0,-1` would invert the vector;
    *   `DIRECTION_OFFSET` would be added to usual normal, for all vectors, so, for example, `DIRECTION_OFFSET=0,-1,0` would skew everything down;
*   Upper fake shadow for track lights;
*   Small fixes.
