# Changelog

## New features, options and improvements

*   Double precision physics engine to improve physics and FFB on large tracks;
*   New Origin Shift feature in Graphics Adjustments, fixing visual shaking on large tracks;
*   New generic configs affecting all cars and tracks;
*   Major rewrite of advanced culling to improve its performance;
*   DXGI tweaks got a few more options (unrelated to flip model):

    *   True borderless mode;
    *   Triple buffering and custom maximum frame latency;
*   Option for SIMD-accelerated visibility culling for tracks;

*   Smart mirror: option to override mirrors rendering distance;
*   Radar app: settings for colors, updated look;
*   Loading smoothness and informativeness greatly improved, thanks to new built-in loading profiler;
*   Loading should be faster now, with option to speed it up further with caching (enabled by default);
*   VAO darkness fixed with dynamically adjustable gamma;
*   Reworked crash messages, now with additional checks and tips;
*   Crash reports include CSP settings preset;
*   Sound speed takes temperature and other stuff into account;
*   GUI: optional warning for throttle and brake pedals overlap;

*   Post-processing refraction improved;
*   Broken glass shader reworked once more;
*   AI-related crashes on tracks without properly recorded AI splines should be fixed (they would just stand there);

*   Car height map is used now to determine if free camera is inside a car;
*   Other cars lighting up your car from behind now produce extra light from rear view mirror;

*   Doors animation and pit crew person with sign pauses with AC;
*   Fake ambient shadows for tracks set via config, to add some darkening under those stationary cars;
*   Small tweaks: option to adjust distance between eyes for VR just in case;
*   Few small optimizations.

## Configs

*   TyresFX: specify tyres pattern for certain tyre types in config;
*   Extended physics for cars: 
    *   Option to use real mass online to improve collisions for heavy cars;
    *   Options to redefine collision parameters;
*   Extended physics for tracks: 
    *   Option to use real mass for cars online;
    *   Options to redefine collision parameters for different surfaces;
    *   Option to use rigid collision between surface and car mesh colliders, to try and prevent cars falling through in some extreme cases;
*   Extended raytracing for advanced tyre collision detection uses fewer samples to speed things up;
*   INIpp: includes now can be optional, with expressions for file names, new functions to access and modify stuff that's already been parsed;
*   New inputs for `read()` for car and track configs;
*   New parameter `SHOW_IN_REFLECTIONS` for track lights (please use it carefully, by default only lights with range above 10 meters is included to speed things up);
*   New filter keywords: `insideWheel`, `insideSuspension` for nodes, `driverPiece`, `isTextureDefault:<texture name>` for materials;
*   Car lights: tint for high and low beams;
*   Car lights and custom emissives: separate lag up/down, custom heating color and other parameters;

*   Car debug app now shows aero fan forces;
*   Optional higher tessellation rate for flags, with tessellation applied to shadows as well;
*   New semi-transparent shadows mode: NORMALS, taking into account surface to attenuate sun light for grazing angles, great for bent glass;
*   CSP renders car window meshes late to ensure correct visuals: filter for such meshes now can be changed to include custom banners and such;
*   Objects Inspector app:
    *   Select skinned meshes;
    *   Surface normal in click point is shown now as well;
    *   Extra tool to simplify creation of fake ambient shadows for tracks (click button `…` when nothing is selected);
*   Photoelastic PBR glass now supports multi-emissives as well.

## Lua & Python

*   Python function `ac.ext_loadIniFileAsJson()` fixed, `ac.ext_parseIniFileToJson()` renamed to `ac.ext_parseIniAsJson()` (old name also works for compatibility);
*   New Python and Lua functions to get track's coordinates, timezone and to check if WeatherFX is active or not;
*   New Lua functions: `ac.getSoundSpeedMs()` to get accurate sound speed, `ac.getAudioVolume('key')` to get audio volume level;
*   New WeatherFX Lua function: `ac.setVAOExponent(gamma)` to set gamma for vertex AO;
*   Lua audio events got a new pitch parameter;
*   Lua Debug App updated: copyable stored and debug values, clickable files in error messages (opening file at correct line for supported editors);
*   Standart Lua libraries now shipped in bytecode form to optimize loading.
