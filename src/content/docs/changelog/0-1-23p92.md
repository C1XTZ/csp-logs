## 0.1.23-preview92-rc (2018-09-24)

*   Wipers, all thanks to hen.ter, of course: 
    *   Wiper guessing;
    *   Smoother transitions;
    *   Edge smear is back;
    *   Animation works in exterior view;
    *   Fixes;
*   A lot of configs are now included, from GitHub repo (never mind increased size, it's temporary, until I prepare a better solution);
*   Wheel shadows now affect dynamic lights properly;
*   Option for trees shadows;
*   Option for reduced tiling;
*   Extension app: copy camera position, toggle lights outlines, check normals in normals only mode;
*   DOF fixed;
*   On rewind, smoke particles are cleared;
*   Render distance increased to 20 km;
*   Options for dynamic distance clipping, in `graphics_adjustments.ini`;
*   Auto-focus in replay photo mode, with ctrl+click;
*   Car lights options:
    *   Disable lights.ini with `DATA/DISABLE_LIGHTSINI=1`;
    *   New `EMISSIVE_CORNERINGLAMP_LEFT_N` and `EMISSIVE_CORNERINGLAMP_RIGHT_N`, for cornering lamps, with `STEER_THRESHOLD` option (in degrees);
    *   Now, `EMISSIVE_LIGHT_N` and `EMISSIVE_BRAKE_N` take part in lights guessing as well, if `LOCATION` is set (use `CAST_LIGHT=0` to disable this behavior);
    *   New `ACT_AS_HEADLIGHTS` option to make emissive meshes get brighter if camera is caught in car headlights;
    *   Set `FALLBACK_HEADLIGHTS_COLOR` and/or `FALLBACK_BRAKES_COLOR` to set emissive meshes brightness if disabled;
    *   As an alternative fallback mechanism, set several lights to act on a single mesh, the one with higher N will have lower priority;
*   Set `VALUE_N=ORIGINAL` or `OFF_VALUE_N=ORIGINAL` for `MATERIAL_ADJUSTMENT` to use original value;
*   `STRICT_SEARCH` option for loading screen, enabled by default;
*   Car instruments in replay fixed;
*   Other fixes.

## 0.1.23-preview92-rc2 (2018-09-24)

*   Light animation for Ferrari 512 TR and some other cars fixed;
*   Option to bind car lights to specific nodes;
*   Loading screen: gradient for three monitor setup is fixed.

## 0.1.23-preview92-rc3 (2018-10-02)

*   Lots of tweaking for the rain;
*   Physics extensions: `INPUT=HEADLIGHTS` and inline LUTs for aero controllers, aero maps, extended raytracing fixed;
*   New `transmission_ext` sound event;
*   New common extension soundbank, actual soundbank is missing for now;
*   Option to switch to older master soundbank if player uses car with old sounds, to fix missing `engine_ext` event (would mess newer cars though, but for now, it's better than nothing; for this thing to work, just put this `old` folder to content/sfx, without overwriting any files: [https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1uJbkr_ZFqaljVizqR8I2rXy2JqoU02_a](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1uJbkr_ZFqaljVizqR8I2rXy2JqoU02_a));
*   Fix for tree shadows in VR;
*   Fix for ambient shadows in replays;
*   Fix for clipping distance if config is missing;
*   Separate shadow settings for tyres and rims (fully compatible with existing configs);
*   Now, tyres should detach more rarely, with Tyres FX enabled;
*   AC crash with non-digit first character in `HEADER/VERSION` fixed;
*   Replays rewinding fixed;
*   Time app fixed, now displaying time in 24 hours range;
*   New type of digital instrument, brake bias (`TYPE=PLACEHOLDER`, `TYPE_EXT=BRAKE_BIAS`, or `[BRAKE_BIAS] DIGITAL_ITEM=N` in extension config).

## 0.1.23-preview92-rc4 (2018-10-06)

*   More rain tweaks;
*   Configs are temporary removed, you can find the latest here: [https://github.com/ac-custom-shaders-patch/acc-extension-config/](https://github.com/ac-custom-shaders-patch/acc-extension-config/);
*   Physics extensions: aero fan (for cars like Chaparral 2J) made by JPG_18, inline 2D-LUTs;
*   Crashes with older mods without compatible soundbank prepared fixed;
*   Shaders fixed: MIP LOD bias won't affect reflections, fresnelEXP properly clamped to 1 so 919 Hybrid 2015 works, trees work better with dynamic lights;
*   Accumulation screenshots work with feedback filters, default MIP_LOD_BIAS value is adjusted again;
*   Loading screen settings reverted back to normal;
*   Few fixed for Tyres FX: damage works in replay, flat spots fading fixed, effects fade with distance smoothly;
*   Cars guessing: for single rally cars, special values will be used;
*   Animated turning indicators;
*   Casted light for turning indicators fixed;
*   New `LIGHTING/CAR_LIGHTS_LIT_MULT` parameter for tracks configs, multiplier for car lights; 
*   Crash on exit fixed;
*   New type of digital instruments,  text appearing on condition (`TYPE_EXT=CONDITION_TEXT`, or `[DI_CONDITION_TEXT] DIGITAL_ITEM=N` in extension config);
*   For brake bias instrument in extension config, section name was changed from `BRAKE_BIAS` to `DI_BRAKE_BIAS`;
*   Single frequency is not a flag, but value from 0 to 1.

*   Configs are in slightly new format (wait for upcoming CM update);

*   Odometers fixed.
