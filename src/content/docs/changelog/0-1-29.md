## New features, options and improvements

*   Smoke changed again:
    *   Option for increased lifespan;
    *   Culling fixed;
    *   Changes in look and behaviour;
    *   It might still be a mess, but more changes will be coming, I'm still trying to find a way to fix performance;
*   Extra FX: various combinations of enabled effects fixed;
*   Motion blur:
    *   Less noisy but blurrier for high pixel speed;
    *   Option to choose between noise and banding;
    *   New ultra setting for reduced noise, about two times more expensive;
*   Stencil flags work better;
*   Motion blur shouldn't break wheels of cars like MP4/4 now.
