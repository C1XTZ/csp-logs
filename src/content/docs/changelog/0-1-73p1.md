# Changelog

## New features, options and improvements

*   Smart Shadows:
    *   Fourth shadow cascade for distant shadows and shadows in mirrors (optional);
    *   Adaptive distance for first split for exterior cameras (distance is reduced if close to a car, optional);
    *   Adjustable blur amount;
*   Extra FX:
    *   Motion blur shader reworked from scratch to improve performance and quality;
    *   Fog blur updated;
*   Various optimizations:
    *   During loading, new bounding spheres are calculated, smaller and more precise;
    *   AABB culling for track geometry, with optional SSE acceleration for reflections;
    *   New culling options: forced culling for pieces partially visible cars, orientation-based culling;
    *   Occluders-based culling (occluders are defined via track config);
    *   Reworked cubemap and shadows reflections rendering for more straightforward and faster rendering;
    *   Option to reproject reflections cubemap to get smoother transition with partial updates;
    *   FidelityFX: with UAV flag for output (optional), no extra copy is necessary, saving some time;
    *   New performance analyzer app with graphs and detailed measurements (going to replace Render Stats later);
    *   Some Python apps without visible windows now go to sleep mode to speed things up;
    *   Python apps profiler updated, now showing nicer average and max (averaged) time;
    *   Extra FX: building light map for bounced light is now faster;
    *   IMGUI blending (used by new CSP apps and more) is no longer slow;
    *   Option to disable car shadows for third cascade for interior and exterior views;
    *   WeatherFX: experimental option to run garbage collector or optional maintanence processing in a separate thread;
    *   A few smaller optimizations;
*   Separate parameters for number of visible cars for exterior views, slightly higher by default;
*   Reflections cubemap: prefilter option to get rid of pixels;
*   Working cubemap reflections in mirrors;
*   MSAA tweaks: resolve with tonemapping to improve quality, optional custom kernel for smoother image;
*   Brake Disc FX: procedural cuts for more complex look;
*   New CSP apps now can be pinned from context menu of their title bar;
*   No more clearing color buffer (optional, help with performance and small holes in some tracks a bit);
*   New option (set via track config) to align trees lighting with surface underneath, helps to improve look of hilly tracks;
*   Navigators now remember the type of camera previously used;
*   CSP would try and fix missing windscreen shader, as well as apply `skip G-buffer` flag to dashboard glass;
*   Option to force headlights for other cars online in Weather FX section;
*   Color grading: GPU-accelerated conversion, now 16-bit and square non-HALD color LUTs are properly supported;
*   GrassFX is enabled by default now.

## Fixes

*   Tyres FX fixed;
*   Backlit glass shader fixed;
*   FidelityFX CAS now applied after FXAA 3.11 and such (CMAA2 was fine);
*   Improved main form detection for the new taskbar;
*   Dynamic shadows fixed:
    *   Flickering shadows in distance fixed;
    *   No more occluding light on tracks like Shuto;
    *   Headlights range fixed;
    *   Proper look for lower poly geometry;
    *   Multiple headlights for a single car now have proper dynamic shadows;
*   GrassFX rarely messing up motion blur and looking all buggy fixed;
*   Disabling CJK symbols fixed;
*   CJK symbols consume less VRAM and don't cause a freeze upon race start anymore;
*   Ghost car obscuring view with strange artifacts fixed, as well as its refraction (disabled by default);
*   Helmets now don't receive sun light in mirrors in enclosed cars fixed and cast proper shadows in first person view;
*   Shadows filtering adjusted to reduce artifacts, shadows from distant geometry fixed;
*   Missing car details in mirrors fixed;
*   Timezones sanity check on launch fixed (no more messed up lighting);
*   No-shadows and no-lighting shader sets were removed to improve loading speed;
*   Refracting lights TAA no longer adds that much lag, also sharper in screenshots;
*   No more pieces spawned from collisions with non-mesh car colliders (those usually are for bottoms and skid blocks);
*   Virtual mirror no longer messes with UI;
*   DXGI flip mode is no longer available in full screen, as it should have been from the start;
*   CSP radar app now fades properly;
*   CSP driver tags work properly with post-processing disabled;
*   Motion blur won't overly blur everything right after camera jumps;
*   Baked fake shadows or car wetness maps now rebuilt if model changes;
*   Actual car model (lowest LOD) now used to calculate car dimensions, because, as it turned out, colliders of some mods are badly misplaced;
*   Misshaded static tyre marks fixed;
*   Ground height estimation fixed for extreme cases (such as when there are holes in the ground nearby);
*   SSLR misbehaving in fog fixed;
*   Python function `ac.ext_getTyreBlister()` no longer crashes AC in certain cases;
*   New flames better compatible with SSLR;
*   Distant blug for fog blur effect removed (fog-based only is enough);
*   Compatibility with AC PRO fixed;
*   Negative mip bias in AC video settings no longer affects performance of GrassFX map generation and such;
*   Issue with disappearing distant emissives fixed, improved look in reflections;
*   Car shadows appear in third shadows cascade, overall rendering improved;
*   More cars visible in high details at once;
*   New main menu is centered in the middle for triple screen;
*   Car paint won't mess up carbon by default now;
*   Extreme specular parameters for car paint won't result in crazy glare;
*   Shader `ksPexPixelAlpha` now functions correctly if alpha parameter is above 1;
*   Live reload of color grading textures in PP editor fixed;
*   WeatherFX: frustum test now has an extra argument to stop heading adjustment;
*   New photo app: motion mode now doesn't reset orbit camera;
*   Distant emissives work with moving objects (such as ferris wheels);
*   Few smaller bugs and crashes fixed.

## Configs

*   Support for BC7 DDS compression (takes the same as DX5, looks much better);
*   New app to arrange track occluders: walls and boxes;
*   New mesh filtering keywords: flag `static` for static track meshes, flag `castsShadows` for meshes casting shadows, number `largerThan` checking bounding sphere radius;
*   Culling mode for dynamic lights shadows is adjustable now, with default changed from double to front-facing;
*   Now it's possible to disable volumetric lights for some headlights;
*   Car inputs: no more zeroing for stalled by default;
*   Extra car animations: hold final state, blend several animations together, blend animations with regular steering animations (can be used for handbrake animation);
*   Original car animations: apply LUT and other postprocessing to alter keyframes selection;
*   Shader replacement: if file for texture replacement is missing, whole thing would be ignored;
*   Car paint shader updated (new `ApplyMatteFix` parameter, applied automatically for v3);
*   Track lights now can skip cars to speed things up;
*   Track meshes can stop casting dynamic shadows;
*   New Python functions: `ac.ext_pauseWhenHidden(frames)`, `ac.ext_isAnyAppVisible()`;
*   New track config value: `[WIND] DYNAMIC_FLAGS_TESSELLATION=1`, change to 0 to deactivate tessellation;
*   New G-buffer flag `ALPHA_TEST_GBUFFER` to enable alpha testing, using ksAlphaRef as threshold;
*   New `INPUT_REFRESH_RATE` option allowing to set custom refresh rate in Hz, 5 Hz by default for digital instruments;
*   Extension configs, both for cars and tracks, now can access track's data.
