## New features, options and improvements

*   New BVH sorting for lights, should improve performance;
*   No more lights merging apart from very distant ones;
*   Speculars for all lights;
*   Dashboard light detection should be more reliable;
*   Extra bounced light;
*   Dynamic bounced light color;
*   Option to hide and replace meshes in tracks, with lights for Brands Hatch as an example;
*   Option to filter out vertices for track lights using UV coordinates (again, for example, check Brands Hatch config);
*   Making a track or a patch adding lights and want lights to increase in brightness when facing camera? Use ksPerPixel shader and set ksAlphaRef to -193.
*   Have a lot of trees on your custom track? Set ksEmissive for ksTree to negative value (like, -0.001), and it won't get extra lights;
*   Brightness with post-processing for virtual mirror fixed;
*   Smart mirror now works only in first person view (that was silly).
