## New features, options and improvements

*   Textures color is considered while guessing light parameters;
*   Popup headlights;
    *   For now, only regular ones, no tricky stuff like Miura's, those I'll prepare later by linking lights to nodes rather than analytically.
*   Some very primitive emulation of bounced light;
*   Overall, guessing is improved, more cars work without adjustments.
