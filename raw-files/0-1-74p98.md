For new content and configs:

- TyresFX: specify tyres pattern for certain tyre types in config;
- Extended physics for cars: 
  - Option to use real mass online to improve collisions for heavy cars;
  - Options to redefine collision parameters;
- Extended physics for tracks: 
  - Option to use real mass for cars online;
  - Options to redefine collision parameters for different surfaces;

- New inputs for `read()` for car and track configs;
- New parameter `SHOW_IN_REFLECTIONS` for track lights (please use it carefully, by default only lights with range above 10 meters is included to speed things up);
