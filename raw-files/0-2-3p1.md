# New

- New bindings for sequential gear shifts (should be a lot more reliable than secondary CM bindings);
- Collider-based LODs updated: shading and shape are a lot closer to actual models;
- New splitscreen race mode (moved from Custom Rendering Modes module, with a bunch of fixes too)¹;
- New option for hiding distant drivers;
- Traffic mode got a top speed multiplier option, as well as a bunch of fixes and performance improvements;
- Delaying system bindings works in fullscreen mode¹.

# Fixes

- Lua audio fixed;
- AI drivers no longer leave pits all at once;
- OpenVR postponed swap doesn’t affect FFB anymore;
- Real Feel Braking sensitivity with cars using LUT lookup and non-100% max in settings fixed
- Collider-based LODs are compatible with LODless cars limit;
- New audio app: transmission volume can be linked to engine volume;
- Loading custom transmission volume setting fixed;
- Bindings for car switches G/H/I/J added to the list;
- Setup tabs order for cars with custom physics fixed again;
- New Modes and Custom Rendering Modes modules are always active (they won’t waste any resources unless activated);
- VAO patch is correctly applied to driver LOD B;
- Shadowed wheels and driver apply to more than just the few nearest cars;
- Plank wear should be included when saving car state;
- Custom driver modes load faster, issues with LOD B are fixed;
- AI payloads cache refreshes if KN5s have been changed;
- Rare crash with extra replay streams (like with brakes with temperature) fixed;
- Windscreen raindrops friction increased;
- Issue with controls conflict message when binding POVs should be fixed;
- Some crashes when trying to load some super broken DDS textures fixed;
- Few smaller bugfixes and stability improvements.

# Car, track & server configs

- Helper springs added to cosmic suspension, see docs for info;
- Full reload reloads lights properly;
- Most of custom physics no longer reloads live to keep things more stable;
- Applying skinned to non-skinned shader replacement (or vice versa) won’t work;
- `ALLOWED_TYRES_OUT` in “race.ini” is respected in offline races (unless value is negative).

# Lua & Python scripting

- New `ac.blockSystemMessages()` to filter out some of the messages;
- New `ac.StateCar.isDriverSeatbeltOn` flag;
- New `ac.GeometryShot():setOpaqueAlphaFix()` for drawing objects with transparent background properly;
- `ac.applyLiveConfigEdit()` works with “custom_rendering_modes.ini”;
- New `ac.loadCarControlsConfiguration()` for Lua apps for some very special cases;
- New `physics.setAllowedTyresOut()` (available for new modes even if the rest of physics API is not);
- New `ac.StateCphysCar.fuelConsumption` and `ac.setFuelConsumption()` for car physics scripts;
- Finite check in physics and custom physics script API changed, should be more informative and less crashy;
- Releasing named Lua textures fixed;
- Disposing Lua textures should clear them too, just in case;
- System messages no longer show for scripts attached to AI driven cars;
- Memory leak and performance issues of `ac.SceneReference:loadKN5LOD()` fixed;
- A few new Python functions.
