<li>Option to average skipped FFB samples for more precise feedback;</li>
<li>Option to reduce update rate for damping FFB (since it’s only used for low speed FFB damping, it makes sense to update it less often. Can help with 99% cpu warnings at low speeds with some wheel bases);</li>
</ul></li>
<li>GPU optimizations:
<ul>
<li>Option to use background BC7 compression for cached CSP textures (such as WeatherFX clouds or billboards of new trees);</li>
<li>Option to use background BC7 compression to re-encode wrongly compressed AC textures so they could load faster and run better on subsequent runs;</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>Generate new fallback LOD for all cars using collider mesh;</li>
<li>Limit amount of active LOD As of cars with a single LOD;</li>
<li>Option to render virtual mirror before the scene in single and triple screen mode (might add some small glitches with refraction and ExtraFX, but save a bit of performance);</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Holding Shift or Alt stops AC system bindings (such as Ctrl+R for replays) allowing to bind extra things to something like Ctrl+Shift+R;</li>
<li>Option in car instruments for car headlights to shake a bit;</li>

<li>Saving and loading car state can be bound to controllers working even if the app is closed;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Default WeatherFX style: a bit of pollution haze in clear weather based on light pollution configuration;</li>
<li>New Traffic race mode (requires configured tracks with <code>traffic-planner-ready</code> tag);</li>

<li>CSP now supports all the system hotkeys from CM for better responsiveness and proper modifier button logic;</li>
<li>Disabling seasons also disables accurate sun trajectory by default (unless it’s an online race and server specifies date explicitly);</li>
<li>Refueling in pits smoothly increases the amount of fuel shown on a dashboard.</li>
