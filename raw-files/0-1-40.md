### v0.1.40

*   Version ID: 937
*   Size: 44.76 MB

#### Changelog:

*   New shader replacement option for extra draw call for colored glass, multiplying stuff behind with constant solid color;
*   All reflective shaders got new `extColoredReflection` option:
    *   Colorizes reflection and speculars;
    *   Set to 2 to use txMaps alpha as a mask;
    *   Set to 3 to use invert of txDiffuse alpha as a mask (same as txDetail);
    *   Otherwise, set any value from 0 to 1;
*   MultiMap shaders with sun specular got new `extColoredBaseReflection` option:
    *   `extColoredReflection` only affects sun specular and reflection;
    *   `extColoredBaseReflection` affects regular specular;
*   Some shaders (`ksPerPixelNM`, `ksPerPixelReflection`, `ksPerPixelMultiMap` and some more) got new `extBounceBack` option:
    *   Adds light bouncing straight back to light source (like bicycle reflectors or traffic signs);
    *   Set any value (around 10 in general);
    *   Can use invert of txDiffuse alpha as a mask (same as txDetail);
    *   New emissive shaders also got this option, as well as `extBounceBackMask` allowing to pick channels in txEmissive;
*   New shader for license plates, with includable config with materials:
    *   Parallax, height is guessed from txDiffuse, with shadows from sun and dynamic lights;
    *   Optional tweaks to lighting and color based on txDiffuse;
    *   Simple emissive mask for better license plate fallback;
    *   Optional extra emissive channel for letters;
    *   Bouncing back light is also supported;
*   New car paint:
    *   Specular settings readjusted for different car paints;
    *   New preset for old car paint;
*   Option for shader replacement to assign different shaders depending on original shader;
*   Fake Shadows FX: works better without shadows, new option for sunlight influence;
*   Fixes:
    *   Extra FX motion blur: new better working (and simpler) quality options, fixes;
    *   Car lights: bug with flickering lights fixed;
    *   Chase camera: bug with wrong sound pitch fixed;
    *   Shadows bugging out into large pixels fixed;
    *   Smooth transition between shadow cascades fixed;
    *   Not working pro view fixed;
    *   Shader replacement messing up textures fixed;
    *   Fake Shadows FX: clipping fixed, invalid drawing fixed;
    *   License plate lights: auto-guessing fixed, default parameters adjusted;
    *   Nice Screenshots extension: resolution multiplier works better with motion blur, motion blur accumulation improved;
    *   No more wind-aware dynamic flags by default (fix for Kunos tracks coming soon);
    *   Cars ambient lighting fixed.
