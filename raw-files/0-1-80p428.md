#### Changelog:

*   RainFX: handling of lightweight racing cars improved;
*   NeckFX: redefine behaviour with a Lua script, helmet rendering got a blur option (and also now works properly, and compatible with RainFX);
*   OBS integration: install an OBS plugin to access additional views, such as view without HUD, HUD only, extra cameras, separate AC apps, etc. (third-party Lua scripts can add their own OBS views too);
*   Default WeatherFX script: optional simplified and faster post-processing alternative to YEBIS (requires new CM to show those new script-specific settings); 
*   New Unbound app (on App Shelf): access functions you might have forgotten to bound with a mouse, from pedals to working with brake balance or turn signals;
*   New WebBrowser app: browse web, pin webpages as new apps and more;
*   New Pocket Technician app: edit car setup outside of pits in offline practice sessions;
*   Emoji support for both regular and IMGUI text (15.0 version, Twemoji pack, works for driver names online as well), emoticon selector in chat is replaced with emoji selector (optional, enabled by default);
*   Few physics experiments moved to be always active in all modes, new experimental car extrapolation option added;
*   Support for gamma sliders for other wheel axis in controls settings (needs a CM update);
*   Yebisest: option to run post-processing in full resolution;
*   BrakeDiscFX glow uses physics temperature if available (which also will be stored in replays now), light intensity reduced to stop things looking that broken;
*   Option to render UI on top of other HUD elements (such as AC driver names or the proximity thing);
*   Hotkeys to alter FOV live;
*   Audio volume sliders for wipers and car Lua scripts;
*   Curved monitor filter now can adjust render scale;
*   New tonemapping function available in filter editor;
*   Option to use detailed shadows and high-quality shading in mirrors in lights settings (very expensive);
*   Option for free camera to automatically switch to single screen mode for triple screen rendering;
*   Option to use real-time car positions for AC leaderboards (such as the one shown with F9);
*   Loading progress is shown on Windows taskbar;
*   CSP Debug app now shows relative position of contact points in its physics tab;
*   Autopilot (Ctrl+C) can be turned off (apps would still think it’s AI driving to avoid messing up stats), old behaviour can be reactivated in settings.

#### Car & track configs

*   The way multiple configs are handled has been changed, giving more priority to subsequent configs (meaning, for example, `[SHADER_REPLACEMENT_…]` from skin config will be applied after `[SHADER_REPLACEMENT_…]` from car config);
*   `[MESH_SPLIT_…]` can work based on UV (had to split 70s helmet for NeckFX helmet rendering);
*   New parameter for extra lights: `AFFECTS_TRACK = INTERIOR_ONLY` stopping light from affecting car exteriors as well (fits well for GT3 interior light, for example); 
*   Car scripts can use conditions (like `INPUT = …`) to only activate when something special happens;
*   New car inputs: `FPS`, `FRAME_TIME_MS`;
*   Car navigators got a few fixes and improvements, such as better camera movement, a new scale widget (for custom oldschool layouts) or a font scale option;
*   InteriorPBR shader is compatible with bending effects;
*   Oil pressure estimate is slightly lower in corners;
*   Custom textures reload live as well;
*   New trees: warning about mishandled compiled trees, GrassFX surface is taken as surface by default now to ensure normals synchronization (lack of synchronization breaks fake shadows), draw calls and triangles are counted properly;
*   Referring to a flashing condition as an input for another condition now works properly;
*   Hide meshes from secondary views (like mirrors) with `INCLUDE_IN_SECONDARY_VIEWS=0` of shader replacement section;
*   Mesh splits and mesh optimization hints are working again;
*   A warning for cars with tyres of version below 3 with `RIM_RADIUS` parameter (might mean somebody set the version wrong and maybe even missed a zero there);
*   New filters: `insideNthWheel:N`, `insideNthSuspension:N`, `driverRoot:N`, `driverNeck:N`.

#### Lua & Python scripting

*   Preprocessor was rewritten, now inlining enums, computing `bit.` calls with enums and a lot more (docs are coming soon), even having access to some of CSP API, currently disabled by default to make sure things won’t break until it would be properly tested;
*   Hold Ctrl to automatically align new pinned windows in Lua Debug app;
*   Lua calls are faster, meaning AC can run more scripts;
*   Visual Code extension updated, sees shared libraries properly as well (documentation is also updated fixing issue with multiline table bug);
*   Scripts such as WeatherFX, NeckFX, Chaser Camera or scriptable filters reload automatically if user settings changed (and CM can show those user settings in CSP settings section);
*   Common API:
    *   New string functions: `:replace(…)`, `:urlEncode()`, `:nextEmoji()`, `:findIgnoreCase()`;
    *   Structures (`ac.StructItem`) can store tightly packed matrices;
    *   Online events: with custom Assetto Server there is no size limit and optional UDP transport mode available;
    *   Load full car and track INI configs;
    *   Timers are more precise, especially interval ones (time of calls would still fluctuate, but it’ll average out perfectly);
    *   `ac.DataLUT11` can be serialized with `stringify()` (also, its parser can handle two types of format now);
    *   Helper `ac.DriverTags` now reads colors from custom CM tags, also added `ac.getDriverChatNameColor()`;
    *   Function `ac.getSkyFeatureDirection()` returns correct direction for ISS;
    *   Web functions can load 16 things at the same time instead of old limit of 4, but it’s still no more than 4 simultaneous requests per domain;
    *   New `ac.getPerformanceCPUAndGPUTime()` for measuring performance live;
*   New state values:
    *   Cars: 
        *   Static: `hasFlashingLights`, `hasTurningLights`, `hasHornAudioEvent`, `hasAnalogTelltale`, `hasCockpitSwitchForUserSpeedLimiter`, `hasLowBeams`, `sirenHorn`, `fuelMaps`, `tractionControl2Modes`;
        *   Dynamic: `isUserControlled`, `wiperSelectedMode`, `autoShift`, `justJumped`, `resetCounter`, `fuelMap`, `speedMs`, matrices to transform to and from graphics offset;

    *   Shortcut `ui.configureStyle()` for quickly altering accent color for subsequent widgets;
    *   If you want to draw extra things with context menus in title bar, use `ui.setTitleBarContentHint()` to specify their position so that original context menu would be hidden;
    *   New `relativePadding` option for `ui.setNextItemIcon()` making it a lot more usable;
    *   Vector icons for creating pixel-perfect things;

    *   Create popups and new windows with `ui.popup()`;
    *   Other popup-related functions: `ui.closePopup()`, `ui.menuItem()`, `ui.beginMenu()`, etc.
    *   Function `ui.beginGroup()` with explicit width now alters default item width too;
    *   Get file icons with `ui.FileIcon` helper;
    *   Updating extra canvases copies and restores render target automatically (shouldn’t break anything unless you were doing something very unusual);
    *   New dynamic textures: `dynamic::final`, `dynamic::mirror` and more;
    *   Set callback to be called when IMGUI pass is done with `ui.onUIFinale()`;
    *   New library `shared/web/browser` allowing to easily integrate Chromium engine to any of your scripts, such a custom web browser, web page acting as a car dashboard or a track display, a simple tab with the rest removed with custom CSS turning into a video or music player supporting modern formats and services, or even just an AC widget with transparency support (actual 100 MB engine will be downloaded with first usage);
    *   Rotating text should work better, with fewer issues with clipping;
    *   Popping something from a stack (like `ui.popDisabled()`) in the wrong moment will throw an error instead of crashing entire game;

    *   New `ui.onExclusiveHUD()` for drawing fullscreen HUD and hiding the rest; 
*   Render API:
    *   New `render.measure()` function for estimating;
    *   New `render.onSceneReady()` event for drawing things right between mirrors and cubemap finished updating but the main render pass hasn’t started yet;
    *   Geometry shots can use track cameras with `:updateWithTrackCamera()`, also reenable driver and steering wheel if they’re hidden with current camera;
    *   Both `ac.GeometryShot` and `ui.ExtraCanvas` got some sort of API merge, both got access to functions like `:setName()`;
    *   Antialiasing modes for `ac.GeometryShot` and `ui.ExtraCanvas` fixed, new YEBIS mode running YEBIS post-processing added;
    *   Accessing texture data works faster with textures pooling;
    *   Share and access textures to/from other Lua scripts or other Windows processes with `ui.SharedTexture()` and `:sharedHandle()`;
    *   Blurring (`ui.beginBlurring()`) fixed, uses mipmaps to improve quality and performance;

*   I/O:
    *   New `io.getFileName()` function;
*   Lua apps:
    *   Manifests will be parsed with extended INIpp features allowing to use expressions;
    *   New `FLOATING_TITLE_BAR` flag working together with `NO_BACKGROUND` to create nicer windows for apps that don’t need title bar and such;
    *   New `FUNCTION_MENU` callback for windows for adding more items to title context menu; 
    *   New `[AWAKE_TRIGGERS] URL = <RegExp>` parameter for awakening your app if URL has been clicked (use `ac.onURL()` to get it when awoken);
    *   New `[CORE] IMMEDIATE = 1` parameter for forcing app to load instantly (use very carefully, it’ll make loading slower);
    *   Override car controls and trigger AC hotkey commands and more (pretty much what Unbound is using for simulating user input reliably);
    *   Similar to background workers, some scripts can create physics workers to access some of physics API from physics thread;
    *   Access list of all app windows, hide, show and move windows around, redirect any app windows to a separate texture (could be used for something like projecting certain AC apps onto separate objects in VR);
    *   Change current desktop with `ac.setCurrentDesktop()`;
    *   Stop apps from working with `[CORE] FLAGS = DISABLED_OFFLINE` and others (docs are coming soon);

    *   Read (and change, but that’s not recommended) any setup values;
*   Car scripts:
    *   Read & write access to F6 cameras;
    *   Alter properties of more audio events, such as skidmarks or wheels;
    *   Set custom navigator text with `ac.setNavigatorText()`;
*   Car access API (car scripts, apps, and more):
    *   New functions `ac.getExtraSwitchName()` and `ac.isExtraSwitchAvailable()` (they can still switch those unless blocked by physics script);
*   Scripts with I/O access:
