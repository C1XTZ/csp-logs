# Extended physics:

   - Gyroscopic FFB attenuation on center enabled by default for Cosmic (necessary for pretty much all FFB wheels on the market);
   - Low speed physics (Sliding Fix) modified;
   - Kunos cubic interpolation LUTs (tyre load sensitivity and camber LUTs) no longer extrapolate (caused numerous issues for modders over the years including unexplained explosions and game crashes);
- Cosmic suspension:
   - Bodies can now be declared for use with KS ARBs (necessary for custom chassis flex to work, otherwise “front” chassis is always used, giving incorrect stiffnesses);
   - Ball joints got adjustable geometry (syntax the same as distance joints);
   - Cosmic body flex (when using ARB_BODY) shows up visually (USE_FOR_ARB must be used; it is the flag for the rear chassis body);
   - Debug lines use exact joint positions;
- Tyres:
   - Thermal Model v2 is supported (docs are coming soon);
   - Better edge-case contact normal calculation (limits contact normals to some threshold from tire radial normal; should avoid strange load spikes and other edge-case phenomena where rays contact the surface strangely);
   - Option to apply relaxation length to forces instead of slip (add `[_EXTENSION] USE_RELAX_LENGTH_ON_FORCE=1`);
- Colliders:
   - Colliders have new wear function available (docs are coming soon);
   - Lua parameters are accessible (`ALLOW_LUA_RESET=1` per collider lets Lua reset wear individually, e.g. in a pit stop);
- Suspension:
   - Damper LUTs display correctly again in the Car Debug app.
- Brakes:
   - Brake thermal model considers ABS (same issue in original physics as well, but to ensure backwards compatibility it won’t be fixed; thanks to Tuttertep for report);
- `TORQUE_MODE_EX` now disabled entirely for axle suspension types (prevents any potential issues that may arise from it);
