Also, rain still isn’t here, sorry about it, but it’s almost finished by now.</p>
<ul>
<li>FSR:
<ul>
<li>Whole thing reworked with officially released SDK: new quality presets, adjusted sharpening, adjusted MIP bias based on documentation tips (old implementation is still present just in case);</li>
<li>Option to set lower quality setting for the left and right thirds of the screen in triple screen mode;</li>
<li>Optional debug mode: hold Space to quickly switch to simple linear upscaling to compare;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Smoke reworked (apart from tyres heating and spawning logic):
<ul>
<li>New improved shading;</li>
<li>Improved collisions between cars and smoke;</li>
<li>Better support for open wheelers;</li>
<li>Tyre smoke spawns below car when drifting angles are big;</li>
<li>Dust and splashes spawns from whole car, not just from wheels;</li>
<li>Dust flies off dusty wheels;</li>
<li>A bit of dust appears for some F1 cars with wooden skid pads when those touch the ground (can be configured on per-collider basis, similar to sparks);</li>
<li>Clouds of dust spawn on collisions;</li>
<li>Smaller particles for bits of dirt and smaller splashes spawn in contact points;</li>
<li>Long-lasting smoke and dust (smoke lasts for several minutes);</li>
<li>When on grass, instead of dust clouds, more subtle soil particles are used (color is set in track config);</li>
<li>New look for smoke from exhaust, heated brakes and damaged engine;</li>
<li>Smoke won’t show up inside a cockpit;</li>
<li>Colored smoke and dust lose color as they expand, with new config parameters to adjust the rate;</li>
<li>Smoke culling improved for further optimization and smoother transitions;</li>
<li>New options to adjust density and on-screen size, to balance between visual quality and performance;</li>
<li>With ExtraFX, there is a new option to get smoke to hide behind glass;</li>
<li>Extra effect with smoke covering whole screen (creates an extra smoky look while being pretty cheap);</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Pieces particles update:
<ul>
<li>Adjusted chances for different types, as well as size and shading;</li>
<li>Collision detection now uses car heightmaps instead of depth buffer for more accurate results;</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Nice Screenshots:
<ul>
<li>Old HDR fix thing is now replaced with brightness-based weighted average; it’s much easier to deal with and produces better results;</li>
<li>Accumulation DOF: options to customize shape and samples distribution for bokeh;</li>
<li>Option to save intermediate result every few steps (so there’d be something saved in case of long accumulation would fail to get to the end);</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Photo mode app:
<ul>
<li>Color adjustments with automatic white balance option (might not work well with some scenes);</li>

<li>Filter chat messages and messages coming from server (in case there is a plugin that uses some of them to communicate with client-side apps);</li>

<p>For new content and configs:</p>

<li>Integrity check for various track files (for example, could be a simple way to make sure important KN5s are not changed online);</li>
<li>Options to allow Lua scripts to manipulate physics objects (don’t use it for competitive tracks, but might be a neat addition for something custom);</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cars configs:

</ul></li>
<li>Tracks configs:
<ul>
<li>New track inputs: </li>
<li><code>CAR_DAMAGE_N</code> for amount of damage of Nth car;</li>
<li><code>CAR_DAMAGE</code> for maximum amount of damage of all cars (could be tied to roof lights of ambulances?);</li>
<li><code>ONLINE_RACE</code> switching to 1 for online races;</li>
<li><code>TIME_SMOOTH</code>: time of day in seconds without rounding;</li>
<li>Deformable track walls for deep collisions (with soft colliders), for tyre walls and such;</li>

<li>New <code>common/particles_track.ini</code> with some presets for track particles (bonfire, stove, flare);</li>
<li>Track config parameter <code>[DYNAMIC_OBJECTS] DISABLE_ONLINE_SYNC=1</code> to disable syncing of dynamic objects online and get them to start from initial position for each new connected client;</li>
<li>Tracks now can use custom model for static reflections or set shader replacements to act upon a default one (good for hiding trees on tracks like Monaco);</li>
<li>Track configs can apply shader replacements to pit stop geometry;</li>
<li>Track displays: use conditions for numerical parameters;</li>
<li>Track config animated clock: minutes fixed, now moves at :00 rather than at :30, also an option for seconds to move smoothly;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For both cars and tracks:
<ul>
<li>Now it’s possible to use videos for textures (with scriptable displays);</li>
<li>Extra mask pass (used for colored glass) shading improved, doesn’t look as messy with darker textures, with new parameters;</li>

<li>Similar to car displays, although without interactive meshes (not that it’s impossible to add them using different APIs if needed);</li>
<li>Access track conditions;</li>
<li>Use physics-affecting functions (only if custom track physics allows display scripts to do so);</li>
<li>Limit updates so they would occur only if camera is nearby;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Track scripts:
<ul>
<li>If you want to control whole track, moving some things smoothly, updating some textures rarely, that might be a better option;</li>
<li>You can update textures live by accessing scene functions, no overhead comparing to scriptable displays, but you can do it only when it’s needed, so it might be faster;</li>
<li>Use physics-affecting functions (only if custom track physics allows track scripts to do so);</li>
<li>Everything else is the same as scriptable displays;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Server scripts:
<ul>
<li>Run on client-side;</li>
<li>Act like track scripts, have the same level of access, but can be loaded from a remote location;</li>
<li>Unlike track scripts, also can draw additional HUD elements, like some messages;</li>
<li>Use physics-affecting functions (only if custom track physics allows online scripts to do so);</li>
<li>Can be used to add some extra logic to things like freeroam servers.</li>
