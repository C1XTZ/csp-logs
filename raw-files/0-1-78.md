#### Changelog:

*   VR update:
    *   Single Pass Stereo, cutting number of draw calls by two;
    *   Variable Rate Shading (aka foveated rendering) for NVIDIA 16…-, 20…- and 30…-gen GPUs;
    *   Optional single YEBIS pass;
    *   Support for corner masking optimization (stops shading in areas covered by lens to speed things up);
    *   ASW 2.0 support for Oculus;
    *   Also, for Oculus: CSP now updates AC manifest, updates assets to show details about the race, closes AC if its VR element is closed;
    *   Better OpenComposite (previously known as OpenOVR) support, for both OpenCompositeACC and regular OpenComposite version (fixing crash with “ipdOffset”);
    *   Crashes in VR now shut down AC first and show errors in a separate process, to make sure VR environment would switch back to desktop;
    *   X-ray rendering for HUD to stop things looking weird if there is some geometry in front of HUD;
    *   Controllers integration: interact with HUD, adjust rear view mirrors, use touchscreens, press car buttons and more (if car has those set);
    *   Experimental option to get driver hands to follow VR controllers;
    *   Optional extra dithering, might help with overly compressed image with Oculus Air Link;
    *   FPS counter for custom VR mirroring;

*   Custom GamepadFX script updated:
    *   Improved implementation;
    *   Separate drifting and racing modes which can be switched while driving;

*   WeatherFX:
    *   Various improvements for cloud covers;
    *   Accurate moon eclipses (need to be enabled by WeatherFX scripts to ensure compatibility);
    *   New API for implementation scripts to create custom effects;

*   Default WeatherFX script:
    *   Distant thunder effects;
    *   Rain haze;
    *   Rain audio;
    *   Auroras (try February of 2022 on a track further than 60° of latitude, such as Ahvenisto Race Circuit);
    *   Fixes for fog, fog covering tops of tall buildings;
    *   Size of planets, sun and the moon fixed;

*   Extra server options:
    *   An experimental option to pause collisions for a bit if remote car would suddenly jump;
    *   Explicitly defined timezone and coordinates to ensure lighting would match with custom tracks with no such properties defined;
    *   Syncing of wheel angles now includes caster;
    *   Custom cars motion fixed, now shouldn’t cause issues with remote cars acting slightly differently when colliding;
    *   An extra option for custom cars motion: smooth motion for slower cars helping with cars shaking on larger tracks (can be activated with `CUSTOM_MOTION = 1, SMOOTH`);
    *   Options to reset car if it got stuck in a collision or falling through ground, with optional penalty;
    *   New core options: force custom cars physics, force custom track physics, hide pit crews to speed up loading (support in CM is coming soon);
    *   Commands to show a message and override ban message, available as new direct TCP commands or compatible chat commands;
    *   Issue with some of `EXTRA_RULES` values allowing to access setup menu without going to pits fixed (set new CSP build ID as a minimum required version);
    *   New rule requiring to finish the lap before going through pit penalty (so people couldn’t reverse back through pits instead);
    *   Set some CSP modules to be required for a server;
    *   If server requires any CSP module using that option, or requires WeatherFX or RainFX using older methods, live settings reload will be disabled;
    *   Option to hide default map app;

*   Features for custom server implementations:
    *   Custom packet format: support for types less than a byte (`CUSTOM_UPDATE_V2`);
    *   Batch update fix fixed (new ID is `BATCH_FIX_V2`);
    *   Servers changing tracks often can specify `FREQUENT_TRACK_CHANGES` feature which will force CSP to update track ID to actual one before connecting;

*   Python:
    *   Better errors handling;
    *   Optional caching to speed up loading;
    *   A compatibility fix: can help if installing an older app breaks a newer app (forces apps to use newest `sim_info` library);

*   New built-in apps (written in Lua):
    *   Controller tweaks: adjust FFB, gamepad or keyboard control options during the race with changes applying live;
    *   Mirrors configurator: adjust Real Mirrors with convenient sliders;
    *   Setup Exchange: publish car setups, load and apply setups made by other people in pits (pits integration is disabled by default, can be enabled in app settings);

*   DDS textures now can have LZ4 compression applied to them to reduce file sizes;
*   A new experimental feature for creating custom external AI implementations;
*   New experimental chunks optimization mode increasing FPS on large tracks;
*   Basic chunks optimization now uses adaptive chunk size, increasing performance for tracks with smaller objects grouped in a separate KN5s;

    *   Automatically detect boxes and replace their colliders with fitting box colliders, also fixing center-of-gravity;
*   Live reload for track cameras;
*   New `[BASIC] NEEDS_LIGHTS_FIX = 1` parameter for cars which have their lighting configured for older broken version of CSP and now having lights that are too bright;
*   New `[BASIC] SPECTATOR_COCKPIT_HR_DISTANCE = N` parameter to increase high-res cockpit distance for spectators, free and track cameras (somewhat fixes dark interior of BMW E30 DTM);
*   New option for trees: use `MATERIAL_FLAG_0 = 1` with `[SHADER_REPLACEMENT_...]` to fade away triangles facing along view direction;
*   Android Auto recreation: better support for smaller displays, offset no longer breaks clicking;

*   Car paints: flag to force sharp reflections on clear coat;
*   Custom cars physics: get tyres to blow up with suspension damage;
*   Custom track physics: slightly randomize spawning positions;
*   Material for distant geometry fixed, now it no longer needs options and, with some caveats, doesn’t have any distance limitations;
*   Subdivide track meshes (helpful for distant geometry fix applying to a giant plane for the ground, like on Shuto);
*   New simple `ksPerPixelAT_NM_emissive` shader for some basic track objects with alpha in `txDiffuse`;
*   New `VRS_FIX` option for shader replacements which should help with some materials getting too dark nearby (and looking horribly with VRS);
*   Accurate PBR materials for tracks with optional displacement (currently in experimental stage).

#### Lua:

*   Custom car physics script:
    *   Access car state (`ac.StateCar` as `car`, it doesn’t update at physics rate, but for some things it should work all right);
    *   Change CD_GAIN and CL_GAIN for wings;
    *   Access and alter body damage and tyres inflation (set to 0 to blow them);
    *   Access more of wheels state;
    *   Move box colliders;
    *   File “script.lua” would be loaded only if “data.acd” is not present, otherwise CSP will search for a file in “data.acd”;
*   Improved handling of custom shaders:
    *   Warnings get printed in log;
    *   Now it’s possible to load shaders from files and use includes;
    *   Line numbers in reported messages match;
    *   Load 3D textures, cubemaps and texture arrays from DDS files;
    *   Bind textures with number of channels other than 4;
*   Library definitions updated to better support updated Lua extension by sumneko;
*   Lua interpreter updated to include the latest improvements added by Mike Pall;
*   New `ui.GIFPlayer()` helper allowing to use animated GIFs in UI and as textures;
*   New `os.addDLLDirectory()` function to simplify loading extra DLLs for things like socket library (also, `package.add()` now adds `cpath` as well);
*   Socket library is included by default now;
*   Lua apps now can create new UI elements for car setup, save and load setups, access setup items and change them;
*   When creating extra canvases, it’s now possible to specify format, including HDR formats;
*   Textures are now reference counted and unload automatically (you’d still need to use `ui.unloadTexture()` to unload textures used in UI);
*   Functions to render quads and quads with custom shader, function for optimized fullscreen pass for extra canvases;
*   Sim value `currentServerTime` stays synced with session change;
*   Access lap splits in sim state;
*   WeatherFX: skip first MIPs when loading a texture, access scene API;
*   INI parser fixed (previously, it could occasionally fail);
*   Car scripts now can switch to neutral gear (could be bound to a mesh button);
*   Car mesh buttons now can be set with local mesh coordinates for moving geometry (like steering wheel buttons);
*   Textureless car scripts now can use mesh buttons too;
*   Force-apply driver animation: allows to add and blend custom rig movements on top of existing animation;
*   See the state of extra canvases with Lua Debug App by assigning them a name with `:setName()`;
*   GamepadFX: access to gamepad settings and more details about car state;
*   Get state of VR controllers, use it to create interactive objects, set controllers vibration or recenter VR headset;
*   Instead of `web.loadRemoteModel()` and `web.loadRemoteAnimation()`, there is a new `web.loadRemoteAssets()` function which can be used for both and more;
*   New functions to get details about drivers: names, teams, nationalities, numbers (uses explicitly set values or, if not set, skin JSONs);
*   Any Lua script now runs only after full sim initialization, thus ensuring state of `ac.getSim()` would be valid;
*   Access shared memory files;
*   Physics API: override or offset user steering, access original steering value;
*   New physics rigidbodies now can be kinetic (have velocity and impact scene, but not get impacted back) and use geometric colliders instead of mesh one;
*   Tracks can allow for scripts to manipulate extra rigidbodies without accessing the rest of physics API, allowing to create dynamic and new kinetic rigidbodies;
*   New `physics.setRestrictor()` and `physics.setBallast()` functions for scripts that can alter physics state;
*   Scene API: new functions for basic set operations on scene references, async loading for new models;
*   Text inputs are no longer limited by 256 symbols;
*   Web requests no longer throw errors if URL is malformed, instead they return errors via callbacks;
*   New parameter for web requests to load headers only, without the payload (not all servers respect `HEAD` method);
*   Car state: pit speed limiter works correctly (aware of session-specified maximum speed, takes into account manually operating limiter);
*   New functions: check if Lua app window is pinned or make a screenshot;
*   Check time gap between cars with `ac.getGapBetweenCars()`;
*   New functions allowing to access extra options and teleport function on server that has it set;
*   Base library: `string.split` and `string.trim` reworked and optimized, new string functions including functions adding regular expressions support;
