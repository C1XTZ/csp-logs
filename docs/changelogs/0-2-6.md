# Changelog

## Fixes

*   CSP audio, such as rain or wipers audio, fixed;
*   FFB on gamepads is fixed;
*   Missing audio files for Mumble client (used in new PTT mode) are included, distortion used in that mode adjusted;
*   Trajectory straightening option for AIs reworked and no longer marked as experimental;
*   Tilted drivers don’t mess up motion blur anymore;
*   Just in case, tilted drivers and new head shaking are optional and can be disabled in Graphics Adjustments;
*   Updated logic for drivers and seatbelts rendering, should fix various issues occuring in some edge cases;
*   Grass wind works in VR with Single Pass Stereo disabled;
*   TyresFX look with Single Pass Stereo enabled fixed;
*   HUD brightness in VR with LCS fixed;
*   New KN5 loader no longer messes up GT86 online;
*   Issue with invisible traffic fixed;
*   Cosmic suspension updated with some fixes;
*   MoTeC logger: wind direction takes into account track heading angle, invalid laps are no longer skipped, new channels added (signs of camber/toe, turbo boost, surface grip, and collider wear);
*   Cosmic suspension: virtual elements (e.g. coilovers) now add to FFB properly when attached to hub;
*   Alternative script for second chase camera now works;
*   New hotkey to toggle H-shifter live;
*   Skidmarks no longer fade on major in-game date change done in the first few seconds of AC launching, rubber marks won’t fade on date changes in-game at all;
*   Skidmarks keep track of winter season adjustments and wouldn’t load if saved version is from a notably different value (affecting dirt- and gravel-style marks);
*   Trees cast shadows in fourth cascade again, this time the shadows are semi-transparent;
*   Semi-transparent shadows (`SEMITRANSPARENT_SHADOWS=1`) produce darker shadows when overlapping;
*   Track meshes with `groove` or `tyre` in their material name and alpha blending rendering no longer skip G-buffer causing SSLR to glitch out;
*   Skidmarks occlude SSLR reflections properly as well;
*   Issue with lamp covers (and other occasions where textures get misassigned) on Shuto fixed;
*   Track light series are cached now, improving Shuto loading speed;
*   A small issue with car dirt stopping resets from working fixed;
*   Currently playing music readout fixed, in particular misassigned album covers;
*   Fireworks no longer activate in showroom mode, firework smoke emitters limit increased;
*   Car stereos update time when music is not playing, album covers are drawn saving aspect ratio;
*   Issue with AC crashing on pressing `Tab` button in chat fixed;
*   Graphics offsets set in `suspensions.ini` no longer count as default (that was a mistake);
*   Audio volume app: transmission volume linking fixed;
*   `CUSTOM_MOTION` option for online now applies by default to servers requiring CSP 3266 or newer;
*   `DISABLE_SURFACE_SNAPPING_ONLINE` (both in `car.ini` and extended server options) fixed;
*   VR Variable Rate Shading: gaze latching, hidden options and API function to adjust gaze direction;
*   ReflectionsFX: cubemap prefiltering stops if resolution is above 512×512, motion extrapolation improved;
*   Cars too far from the ground no longer have fake shadow glued to them;
*   TyresFX effects going out of sync with wheels rotation with animated suspensions fixed;
*   Fireworks no longer mess up sky with WeatherFX disabled;
*   Default WeatherFX style: blue nights reworked and disabled by default, YEBIS replacement got proper bloom implementation and an option for dirty lens (disabled by default), film grain intensity can be adjusted, planets are fixed and now visible despite light pollution;
*   Earth texture uses bicubic interpolation;
*   Saturn got rings;
*   Issue with reduced tyre wear fixed;
*   Couple of physics experiments (alternate multithreading and physics objects motion) are moved to complete, enabled and available everywhere;
*   Track fix activating double-sided shadows for everything now works for tracks saved incorrectly as well;
*   If server stops sending UDP packets (with other cars connected) for a few seconds, CSP shows a warning;
*   WeatherFX: scene render callback malfunctioning in VR without SPS fixed;
*   Cars with animated suspensions also get their initial wheel rotations randomized;
*   Firm collisions (happening on exceptional collision depth which is now computed differently) are not bouncy and better configured, main car never gets simplified contacts computation to ensure collisions will remain stable even in the strangest of cases;
*   Distant headlights glare is reworked and brought back (activates further away to hide the fact that a lot of cars don’t have lights aligned with emissives, now works with other car lights too, still disabled by default for now);
*   Tyre spikes leave marks on the ground even if there are no `ksTyres` meshes (which is still not recommended at all);
*   Issue with F5 camera occasionally glitching out into black screen fixed;
*   A safety check to ensure camera wouldn’t end up in non-finite coordinates;
*   Warning message if player’s car is found in non-finite coordinates;
*   Very experimental trick to select a specific slot for online (for servers with multiple cars of different skins), CM support is coming soon;
*   Ice physics: FFB adjusted;
*   AC shutdown process updated to speed things up and improve stability;

## Configs

*   New `DISTANCE_CLIP` for track lights stopping light at certain distance, for extra optimization and to simulate some basic shadows without using shadow maps;
*   New `[EMISSIVE_...] NO_FALLBACK_WHILE_BLINKING=1` for car configs, stops fallback values from activating in `off` stage of blinking of main input;
*   `IS_VISIBLE` for `[MESH_ADJUSTMENT]` and `[SHADER_REPLACEMENT]`;
*   Debug side nets offset using `DEBUG_OVERRIDE` changing final offset amount (within limits);
*   `DistantEmissive` material now supports normal maps (used by light covers on Shuto, for example);
*   New `PROHIBIT_AC_RESET` for wearable colliders entirely stopping AC from resetting collider wear on session resets;
*   New `DIM_EMISSIVE_IN_CUBEMAP` for `[SHADER_REPLACEMENT]`;
*   Side nets (and, for example, antenna of BMW E30 using the same mechanism for tilting) take high-frequency part of G-forces for a tiny bit of extra offset for more natural look;
*   Track configs will look for files next to configs if file names are starting with `./` (to keep things compatible);

## Lua

*   `ui.imageState()` fixed;
*   Function setting MIP bias for UI now can force bicubic interpolation as well;
*   Some Lua functions, such as `io.` and `os.`, have been rewritten, so the standard library is 15% smaller now, and some features are loading on-demand;
*   Marking drivers as friends should work now;
*   New `os.setCurrentFolder()` affecting file search, including standard Lua functions, doesn’t affect AC itself or other scripts;
*   `web.socket()` fixed (previously received data would often come back mangled);
*   Lua preprocessor fixed and no longer produces invalid code in `ENUM..somethingElse` case;
*   Lua shaders: option to hint compiler to compile certain values in (should solve all problems with YEBIS replacement setting changes causing a lag, now all the settings are not compile-time, but apply as compile-time after some time running);
*   Audio events loaded from files without `loop` parameter now report as invalid once they’re finished playing, since they do become invalid;
*   `:resetSkin()` no longer affects dynamic car textures;
*   New `ac.setHShifterActive()` for Lua apps;
*   Lua Debug app: time stamps for log messages;
*   `ui.drawCarIcon()` got a parameter for a hint;
*   `physics.resetWearPlanks()` is deprecated (copy of `ac.resetColliderWears()`);
*   New `ac.getSim().timeSinceLastUDPPacket` just in case;
*   New way of passing C++ API functions now processes `nil` when string is expected as an empty string, similar to old way (in 0.2.5 mistakenly it would show up as `'nil'`, functions such as `ac.setMessage()` were affected).
