# Changelog

## New features, options and improvements

*   Wet surfaces looking red/green fixed (debug view somehow managed to leak through rebuilding process again, need to make things more robust);
*   A small issue with tyres with custom physics occasionally spinning in a wrong direction on landing fixed;
*   New parameters for new custom physics setup items: UNITS and DISPLAY_MULTIPLIER;
*   WeatherFX weather selector for online servers works now (was broken in p428, thankfully that system is only for visuals);
*   Autopilot should work better and restore car to its original state when released to a better degree (also, servers now can allow new AI with `[EXTRA_RULES] ALLOW_AI` in extended config);
*   Issue with timers in Lua causing Controller Tweaks to not apply changes live fixed;
*   Gamepad buttons can be bound to extra CSP functions (such as clutch) again;
*   Chaser Camera: car transformation in car state no longer lags a frame behind;
*   Rain AI trajectories no longer break around starting line for circuits;
*   Lua: remote images and web requests should load faster, no longer having that two seconds delay in the queue introduced in p428;
*   NeckFX helmet will be disabled in VR for now until I find a good way to move it without it being annoying;
*   Few fixes for YouTube in Android Auto;
*   Rare crashes detected by CM when AC is shutting down should be fixed;
*   A few smaller stability improvements and fixes for some specific crashes (like the one in Objects Inspector);
*   Multiple fixes for the whole DualSense, DualShock and GamepadFX thing, now it should be a lot more reliable at connecting to a gamepad youâ€™d forget to poke before starting a race, better handle mouse movement and more;
*   Also, Setup Exchange backend have been fixed, optimized and moved to a new server, so it should work noticeably faster.
