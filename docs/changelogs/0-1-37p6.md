## New features, options and improvements

*   Weather FX update turns out to be quite big, with new and new options being added. New clouds still look pretty sad, but I think theyâ€™re improving, although there is still a lot of work to do with shape and materials. Also, now sun is properly blinding too
*   Added some new features for post-processing filters as well: custom glare shape for first person view, a couple of extra options for anamorphic glare, plus color grading got strength parameter. Plus, now that post-processing extending module, Yebisest, got a couple new options to forcefully disable lens and anamorphic glare in first persion view. Oh, and also, I added an optional replacement for that post-processing selector app, with a nice dropdown list, grouping, searching and built-in filter editor allowing to see changes in real-time
