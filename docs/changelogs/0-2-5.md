# Changelog

## New features, options and improvements

*   New Quick Drive mode `Drift Challenge` made by Neoned for some proper drifting;
*   SurfacesFX:
    *   New ice physics made by Dmitrii, automatically applying to some older tracks with ice surfaces (optional);
    *   If any ice surface is present, cars get extra tyre sets with spikes;
*   New Quick Drive mode `Frozen Drive` turning any track surface into ice (online servers can also activate this mode);
*   New KN5 loader:
    *   Uses files mapping for more efficient loading;
    *   Skips unused textures (for now optional, disabled by default);
    *   Shares mesh data and materials across different cars to save RAM and VRAM (mesh compression option also has been moved there);
    *   Skips meshes removed with `[MODEL_REPLACEMENT_…]` entirely;
    *   Strips unnecessary data from physics-only meshes to save RAM;
    *   A bunch of smaller optimizations for rewritten logic;
*   Default WeatherFX style:
    *   Brightness has been reworked for nights, lights, emissives, driver tags, etc.;
    *   Snow for snowy weathers or low temperatures with rain (currently needs RainFX to operate);
    *   Ash for smoke weather type (for now, also needs RainFX since they’re sharing the same underlying mechanisms);
    *   Option to draw nights a bit more blue;
    *   Some basic tornados in background for tornado weather;
*   New physics experiments:
    *   Stalling for cars that don’t have custom physics scripts reactivating stalling (if button is not bound, gas pedal starts the engine);
    *   New car collision logic (pretty much the same for now, but with a slightly different method to estimate damaged side);
    *   Fix for surface parameters assignment on tracks with incorrectly named meshes (they were ending up treated like walls);
*   TyresFX:
    *   Tyres visually grow with angular velocity to match their physics state;
    *   Blown tyres visuals and animation improved a bit;
*   Better Joycon support with an optional buttons remapping to better fit a single piece;
*   If selected engine map is linked to something in a car config, its state will be exchanged online and stored in replays;
*   Driver model tilts and moves with G-forces using that weird bit of code added earlier for driver weight shifting;
*   G-forces now also apply to driver’s head (a bit of extra movement on top of original logic);
*   Option to load inactive seatbelt geometry (might mess up some cars using it for some niceties in the showroom, so it’s disabled by default);
*   Held parking brake: option to configure speed threshold;
*   Experimental AI spline optimizations have been fixed and now enabled by default as proven to work;
*   Mumble integration: new adaptive PTT mode for servers (talk freely to people nearby, or hold PTT button to talk to everybody);

    *   Option to briefly desaturate image on collisions;
    *   Option to hide driver in VR and keep only gloves;
    *   Android Auto screenshots thing has been disabled and moved here;
    *   Custom driver models: faster loading;
*   New audio adjustments in General:
    *   Option to alter track ambience audio: remove all samples but one and instead use it to keep ambience working everywhere (General/Audio/Reposition AC ambience);
    *   Option to alter AC ambience based on conditions (audio is loaded on-demand, more samples are coming soon; if disabled, audio will simply be lowered at night, kind of like generic config was doing previously for Kunos tracks using `AMBIENCE_VOLUME_CONDITION`);
    *   New audio tweak to use actual throttle value (altered by gearbox cutoff or throttle curve) for audio;
    *   Option to mix in external audio with opened doors or for roofless cars;
    *   Alternatively, option to always play external audio together with interior audio (has an option to adjust AC reverb intensity);
    *   An experimental tweak slightly altering engine audio when damaged;

*   Collision audio logic updated (samples are still the same for now though);
*   Blowing tyres forcefully activate mesh collider;

*   Free camera respects cars exposure hints now;
*   For wheel inputs, as well as CSP ones, each section in `controls.ini` now can have an alternate binding in a `[__ALT_<NAME>_<N>]` section, where `<NAME>` would be the name of original section (i.e. `GLANCELEFT`), and `<N>` is any number (alternate binding could use any other device or whatever; not sure about CM support at this time though);
*   G27 lights: option to use AI shifting thresholds;
*   A couple of physics experiments are moved to the `done` section: the one smoothing controls locking and the one that randomizes wheel angles. Few other experiments are now enabled by default;
*   Automatic braking deactivation (from that physics experiment) now works in pitlane, but still not available in pit stop;
*   Some unnecessary settings have been hidden or removed.

## Extended physics

*   Fixed overheating tyres in the rain on some cars when stationary;
*   Bug fixes for COSMIC suspension;
*   Steering column flex supported by COSMIC (though unlikely to be stable at 333Hz);
*   Fixed longitudinal G-input for TC/TC2 controllers with extended physics;
*   Tyre thermal model V3 is WIP with some additional features comparing to older models;
*   New native MoTeC data logger available (requires extended physics to be enabled) with logging rates up to 333 Hz;
*   Use `OVERRIDE_BLANKETS_TEMP` in `tyres.ini/[FRONT/REAR]` to override blanket temperature on per-tyre basis;
*   In some cases AC requires LUT to be a file and doesn’t accept inlined values, for example, with `PERFORMANCE_CURVE`. Now, you can use `__INLINED:` prefix, and the rest will be loaded as an inlined LUT.

*   YouTube thing in Android Auto was updated once again;
*   Sun shape is drawn into reflection cubemaps;

## Configs

*   Online:
    *   Custom server loading background images no longer use forced caching allowing servers to update contents live (please remember to set caching headers appropriately if your image is static, or I’m going to be very upset);
    *   New `[EXTRA_RULES] AFK_AUTOKICK = <TIME>, [INPUT/SPEED]` option for online servers (time in minutes, `SPEED` means stationary cars will be kicked, while `INPUT` is tracking car inputs and mouse position);
    *   New option for online configs disabling snapping to the ground for specific cars (in case somebody would want to fly planes or something like that);
    *   Disable autobraking with `[EXTRA_RULES] DISABLE_AUTOBRAKING=1`;
*   Car configs:
    *   New `INPUT=DATE`, format can be tweaked with `DIGITAL_ITEM_NUMBER_FORMAT=DATE, '%d.%m.%Y'`;
    *   F1 rain lights behavior can be activated for pitlane lights with `[DATA] RAIN_LIGHT_<meshname>=1`, automatically activates if mesh contains `rain` (ignoring case);
    *   Digital instruments can be added using `[DI_…] INPUT=GAS` syntax, as alternative to `[DI_GAS_…]`;
    *   Configure throttle value to use for audio using `[AUDIO_TWEAKS] USE_ACTUAL_THROTTLE=<0/1/FULL/CUTOFF,CURVE,LIMITER,TC>` (`1` or `FULL` fully syncs up throttle with physics);
    *   Configure rate of change for some audio values, specifying max change per frame;
    *   Explicitly configure toggling animations to alter CPU heightmap;
    *   Set an animation to alter rain occlusion data (currently, only a single geometry on/off animation can do that);
    *   Setting `INTERIOR_FAKE_UPPER_SHADOW_FADE` or `INTERIOR_FAKE_SHADOW_FADE` to a negative value now forces CSP to ignore all `INTERIOR_FAKE_…` settings except `INTERIOR_FAKE_SHADOW_OPACITY`. Defaults depend on if car has a roof or not;
    *   New `[LIGHT_HEADLIGHTS] LOWBEAM_MULT=0.5` value specifying intensity of low beams comparing to high beams;
    *   Logic for `FADE_FAKE_SHADOW` improved, now taking into account dynamic lights intensity (please only use `FADE_FAKE_SHADOW` for extra lights that might point under the car);
    *   Real Mirrors: use `CAMERA_POS` and `CAMERA_LOOK` in a `[REAL_MIRROR_…]` config to alter the camera position for rear view displays;
    *   Car skins car override driver position and animations;
    *   New `TORQUE_OFFSET` for shaking exhausts (Porsche cars automatically get value of 1 to match their engine orientations and get exhausts to shift a bit with a lot of torque coming from the engine);
    *   Bind extra car lights with `BIND_TO_HIGHBEAM` or `BIND_TO_LOWBEAM`;
    *   Redirecting car audio (`[AUDIO_REDIRECT] CARS=…`) fixed;
    *   Cars can use shared loaded on-demand soundbanks (`[AUDIO_REDIRECT] SHARED=…`), currently available: `x4fab.test_peugeot_504` (CUPv2 users with certain permission can upload new soundbanks), could be useful for traffic;
    *   `car::` and `track::` textures use skin textures if they’re overwriting the ones in KN5;
    *   New `BLIND_SPOT` input for cars, a quick estimation of blind spot behaviour (use `INPUT_SELECTOR=0` for left and `INPUT_SELECTOR=1` for right, returns distance to the car);
    *   Different flame types can be assigned to different flame points source groups, up to three groups in total;
    *   CSP now uses `GRAPHICS_OFFSETS` from `suspensions.ini`. for default visual wheel and rim offsets for cars without animated suspension;
    *   Digital instruments: switch blend modes using `[DATA] DI_0_BLEND_MODE = ADD` (for HUD of M4 to switch to additive blending);
    *   Cars with a prefix `rss_` can no longer use `FADE_FAKE_SHADOW=0.8` value (it was meant for extra lights illuminating ground under a car);
*   Tracks:
    *   Track coordinates and time zone are loaded from `surfaces.ini` first;
    *   New `_EXT_WEAR_MULT` for `surfaces.ini`;
    *   `kn5::` textures (using strictly original textures) are now available to tracks as well;
    *   If not explicitly configured, track heightmap now includes all renderable physics surfaces, not just the ones adding dirt;
*   New inputs for both car and track configs: `LIGHT_SUGGESTION` (1 if WeatherFX style suggests AIs to activate headlights, 0 otherwise, smooth transition in-between), `RACE_STARTED`, `RACE_FINISHED`, `SESSION_TYPE`, `ROAD_GRIP`;
*   Light bounceback is available for `ksPerPixel`, `ksPerPixelAT`, `ksMultilayer_fresnel_nm` (great for track lines), adjusted to work better with LCS;
*   Lua libraries loaded by configs are working properly now;
*   New developer option to crash when F12 is pressed (if loading is getting stuck, use it and send me the crash report please);
*   Hidden option for extensive FMOD logging;
*   ReflectionsFX debug app: brightness slider to help debug reflections with LCS active;
*   Flags for CSP configs to change logic based on LCS presence (not recommended to use).

## Lua

*   Common:
    *   `ac.debug()` fixed, now can handle change of the value type (previously, it would, for example, ignore `nil` as a value, if at first it saw a number);
    *   Timeouts for `web.` can be adjusted, defaults are lower to better reflect the fact that we’re in 21st century now;
    *   New parameter for `ac.trackProgressToWorldCoordinate()` to use linear interpolation;
    *   New functions `ac.distanceToRender()` and alike to quickly compute distance to main camera (handles case with multiple main cameras better);
    *   Typo in `ac.setClipboadText()` fixed (old name still works);
    *   `web.` API asks Windows to use HTTP2 and TLS1.3 (requires Windows 11 to work though);
    *   Similar to cars, Lua scripts now can refer to track textures with `track::kn5::…` (to load explicitly from KN5) and `track::track::…` (to load from a skin if present);
    *   Pass `true` to `ac.iterateCars.ordered()` for an inverse order;
    *   New `ac.AudioEvent():setVolumeChannel()` method linking audio event to one of existing volume channels;

*   New `ac.areCarsColliding()` for gameplay scripts working even if collisions are disabled by checking colliders directly (could help if you’re looking into re-enabling disabled collisions without jumps, for example);
*   New Modes can load car state properly;
*   UI:
    *   `ui.GIFPlayer()` got an option to instead stream raw RGBA data directly for unusual animated images;
    *   `ui.toast()`: add an extra button to the toast;
    *   `ui.onDriverNameTag()` got an option to change item size, as well as a few fixes;

    *   `io.save()` got an option to ensure safe proceedings without data loss;
    *   OpenSSL library `https://github.com/wahern/luaossl` is available in `shared/…` for scripts with I/O access (possibly temporary limitation);
*   Scene API:
    *   Lights and audio sources can be linked to `ac.SceneReference` with `:linkTo()` method;
    *   Loading KN5 into the scene without wrapping it into a bounding sphere will create a bounding sphere automatically;
    *   Functions to load KN5s now take an optional filter (something like `{ ! renderable:no }`) can be useful if you want to use a single KN5 for both visuals and physics collider;
    *   Extra models loaded into `staticRoot` or `dynamicRoot` now cast shadows properly;
    *   `:applySkin()` improved, now can be used multiple times;
    *   `:resetSkin()` can undo the entire car skin as expected;
    *   Compiled Lua shaders now will be cached even without `cacheKey` parameter, unless `cacheKey` is set to `false`;

    *   New `ac.overrideCarState()` allowing to entirely replace a certain aspect of car state as it’s being sent to the graphics thread;
    *   New `ac.setTurboExtras2()` which is actually usable (treats lags properly);
    *   New `ac.setTyreWearMultiplier()` just in case;
    *   Reloading script resets extra weights properly, weights properly integrate with chassis flex;
*   Physics API:
    *   `physics.RigidBody()` can be used by track scripts (with `surfaces.ini` tweak, or mentioned in `surfaces.ini`) as it should’ve been, that was an unfortunate bug;
    *   When using KN5 for `physics.RigidBody()`, it is now possible to specify mesh name or filter, respect mesh transform in KN5 and highlight mesh wireframe for debugging;

    *   New `physics.lockUserGearboxFor()` acting similar to how car acts before the race starts;
    *   If stalling has been reenabled by a script, pressing backspace no longer activates starter, custom physics scripts can instead apply custom starter torque;

    *   New simple tornado effect (`render.tornado()`);
*   Libraries:
