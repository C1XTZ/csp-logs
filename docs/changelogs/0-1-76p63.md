# Changelog

## New features, options and improvements

*   FSR: 
    *   Whole thing reworked with officially released SDK:

        *   Option for adjusting MIP bias according to recommendations;

    *   Improved smoke-cars collisions;
    *   Better support for open-wheelers;
    *   Tyre smoke spawns below car with extreme drifting angles;
    *   Dust and splashes spawns around car, not just from wheels;
    *   Dust flies off dusty wheels;
    *   A bit of dust appears for some F1 cars with wooden skidpads when those touch the ground (and can be configured on per-collider basis, similar to sparks);
    *   Clouds of dust spawn on collisions;
    *   Smaller particles for bits of dirt and smaller splashes spawn in contact points;
    *   Long-lasting smoke and dust (lasts for several minutes);
    *   When on grass, instead of dust clouds, more subtle soil particles are used (color is set in track config);
    *   New look for smoke from exhaust, heated brakes and damaged engine;
    *   Smoke won’t show up inside a cockpit;
    *   Colored smoke and dust lose saturation with expansion, with new config parameters to adjust the rate;
    *   Smoke culling improved for further optimization and smoother transitions;
    *   New options to adjust density and on-screen size, to balance between visuals and performance;
    *   Extra effect with smoke covering whole screen, to get effect of camera stuck in smoke much cheaper;
*   Pieces particles update:
    *   Adjusted types chances, size and shading;
    *   Collision detection now uses car heightmaps instead of depth buffer for more accurate results;

    *   Soil color is taken into account;
*   GrassFX:
    *   Active ExtraFX pass option now properly supports fake car shadows reprojection;
    *   Grass deformation updated, now takes into account grass height;
*   New rendering modes: 360°, fisheye, split screen (new Content Manager supports custom modes for AC video settings);
*   Specify joypad index for joypads input mode;
*   Support for VAO patches v5 with spatial AO samples for dynamic objects;
*   New sky mesh with more evenly distributed triangles for better reflections and mirrors;
*   Option to hide console;
*   Option to create portals to other servers online for freeroam servers;
*   Scene tweaks from new photo mode app remain active in replay with app hidden;
*   If VR failed to initialize, there’ll be a warning on loading screen (especially helpful if you accidentally chose wrong render mode);

*   Masking pass shading improved, doesn’t look as messy with darker textures, new parameters;

    *   Link clutch damage to exceedingly high torque;
*   Custom track physics:
    *   Soft walls fixed, with new `MAX_DEPTH` option to limit softness for collisions that are too deep (docs are coming);
