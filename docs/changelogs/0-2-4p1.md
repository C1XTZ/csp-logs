## Changelog

*   WeatherFX: option to increase conditions limits allowing for controllers to set temperatures and wind speed outside of safe ranges;
*   New experimental option in General/Development (at the bottom) enabling instant replays online;
*   New apps switcher appearing with Ctrl+Tab (Tab button no longer shows leaderboard if any modifier is pressed);
*   New taskbar: desktop icons are replaced with previews (use settings to select icons instead if needed);
*   Default WeatherFX style:
    *   New upper clouds layers;
    *   Falling stars at night (pretty small chance to see them though)
    *   Auroras look slightly improved;
    *   All extra effects are now optional;
*   Physics experiments:
    *   Early collider activation is enabled by default again, this time much safer and uses number of wheels touching ground instead;
    *   New experiment for tweaking car collider meshes: makes sure early collider activation won’t have any problems like before;
    *   New experiment for expanding collider boxes vertically: decreases changes of a box phasing through the ground and, as a result, whole car passing through if falling flat;
    *   New experiment for smooth transition to 0° steering angle when AC is paused (to make sure nothing would break because of sudden change like that);  
*   Radio update (in case you were missing music in AC, thanks to badradio.nz for the idea):
    *   List of stations and the actual playback are now handled on CSP side, while Lua scripts can connect to it and control things;
    *   Default list of stations updated, including more up-to-date ones;
    *   CSP uses advanced API provided by radio.co and laut.fm to collect extra information about currently playing music;
    *   Android Auto: playback moved to CSP side, support for new features such as album covers and track info (if available);
    *   New Internet Radio app on App Shelf: automatically resumes playback on launches (optional, enabled by default), convenient UI to manage list of stations;
*   Photo mode app: 
    *   Use mouse wheel for zooming when viewing a complete screenshot;
    *   Screenshots with resolution multiplier use FSR for downsampling (unless zoomed in);
    *   Hotkey for preview shot is working again, now switched to Alt+F8 (apparently Ctrl+F8 toggles mouse);
*   Smart Shadows: 
    *   Option to compute splits automatically based on distance for simpler adjustments and better splits arrangement;
    *   Option to draw shadows around camera instead of drawing them in front;
    *   Shadows stabilization is greatly improved;
*   New AI Spline Editor app: load an AI spline and tweak its trajectory and sides by dragging them around;
*   New CPU optimization preventing loading of certain audio samples for other cars (might help a bit with 30+ car servers);
*   New option in Small Tweaks to increase GPU priority of web browser backend processes (enabled by default, should prevent issues with HAGS in Windows 11);
*   GUI: option to draw AC apps together with IMGUI UI for better interoperability and similar blurred backgrounds;
*   ExtraFX: options to only use effects in replays;
*   CSP Debug app: option to render car colliders;
*   New pause: admins can restart or skip sessions from there directly;
*   Traffic planner: copy a lane with an offset, specify vertical offset when exporting splines.

## Extended physics

*   SurfacesFX fixed and adjusted, new `TYPE_HINT = GRAVEL` for tyres and more gravel-related options;
*   Differential bug (211 only) fixed;
*   `TORQUE_MODE_EX` now disabled entirely for axle suspension types (prevents any potential issues that may arise from it);

    *   Bounced light for headlights and brakes (non-ExtraFX one) works properly;
    *   License plate lights are a bit dimmer, fallback emissive fixed;
    *   nePBR shaders should look closer to how they looked before LCS;

    *   Rain AI splines no longer created on tracks with splines longer than 50 km or with more than 100k points;
    *   AIs can handle cars with street and semislick tyres, no longer spam logs if a Lua app stops AIs from visiting pits to change tyres;
    *   AIs no longer change rain tyres on the last laps;
    *   Issue with RainFX misbehaving if other cars are driven in areas unvisited by player before causing all sorts of problems fixed;
    *   Fallback data in areas with no puddles computed has also been fixed (was using water instead of wetness often resulting in increased slipperiness);
*   ExtraFX works again with MSAA disabled;
*   SSLR should work better, especially with LCS active;
*   `[PITS_SPEED_LIMITER] SPEED_KMH=…` no longer breaks ERS and such;

*   SkidmarksFX: fading on loading fixed (config wasn’t respected), fading values are now printed in CSP log with `Skidmarks fading` prefix;
*   Spotify music detection removed (wasn’t that reliable or informative, and everybody has moved to Windows 10 with much better music status system);
*   Logic for disallowing overlapping of AC forms updated, now shouldn’t cause apps to jump around too much; overlapping highlight is fixed too;
*   Users with non-latin usernames can be tagged by typing first latin symbol or digit instead and pressing Tab;
*   CSP should be able to handle files in UTF-16/32 BE/LE with/without BOM encodings (might lead to change in behavior if you’d be using a car with some config incorrectly saved in UTF-16 and failing to be parsed before);
*   App Shelf: main lua file is extracted last and renamed after extracting, should ensure there’ll be no failed installations;

## Configs and tools

*   Distant lights can pair with associated meshes with a new `[LIGHTS_DISTANT_LAYER_…]` meshes list and `DISTANT_LAYER` lights option stopping them from contributing to overall lights limit (docs are coming soon);
*   Lights with large radius or fade-out distance now will end up in a separate 4 km chunks thing (previously it was only 800 m chunks, and fade-out distance wasn’t taken into account at all);
*   Lights with fade-out or range larger than 4 km will count as dynamic and remain outside of chunks;
*   New online option: `CUSTOM_MOTION = 1, RESET` resetting interpolation when car teleports (once tested and verified, will be enabled by default for all servers);
*   Tracks: add alternative splines named `ext_alt_fast_lane_?.ai` to `ai` folder and CSP would use those for random cars for something like alternative paths NFS5 Porsche style (not used by track day car respawning for now);
*   Use `MATERIAL_FLAG_1 = 1` on MultiMap_emissive shaders to switch to UV2 for txEmissive;
*   Use `MATERIAL_FLAG_2 = 1` on MultiMap_NMDetail shaders to use alpha of txDetail as a multiplier for reflectivity as well;
*   UV2 patches no longer load if generated from non-triangulated meshes (CM update filtering things on its side is coming soon);
*   `emSkipDiffuseMap` for emissive shaders now takes values in-between of 0 and 1, allowing to limit txDiffuse contribution;
*   Set `emSkipDiffuseMap` to -1 (or use `CustomEmissive_UseDetailInsteadOfDiffuse` mixin) to switch emissive shaders to use txDetail as a multiplier to txEmissive (instead of txDiffuse);
*   Add a second argument 1 to `CLUSTER_THRESHOLD` for lights and such in track configs to switch to clustering in 3D (slightly slower);
*   New `[BASIC] INTERIOR_CLIPPING = …` option for cars specifying if grass, skidmarks and fake shadows should be clipped for interior views (by default enabled for non-open wheelers);
*   New `FORCE_MINUS_TWO_LOD_BIAS` thing for shader replacements (please don’t use unless really have to);
*   New trees: AO baking now can be adjusted;
*   Hidden experimental option `general.ini/DEV/NANORT_SCENE_RAYCAST` to build accelerating structures for faster mesh raycasting (might increase memory consumption and make first raycasts slow);
*   Hidden experimental option `general.ini/DEV/VIRTUAL_REPLAYS_ALLOCATION` to use a magical VirtualAlloc function for replays instead of allocating small bits of memory and increasing them as more frames are being recorded;
*   Trees Inspector now shows more details about selected tree;
*   Volume peak: devices are filtered based on regexps in `small_tweaks.ini`.

## Lua

*   Common API:
    *   New `string.pack()`, `string.packsize()` and `string.unpack()` compatible with Lua 5.3 behavior;
    *   New `string.urlCheck()`, `string.urlNext()` and `os.parseDate()` functions;

    *   Functions to work with view and projection matrices, including getting matrices from `ac.GeometryShot`;
    *   `ac.OnlineEvent()` got an option to receive messages that could have been sent before app has loaded (also, issue with messed up data when receiving two messages at once fixed);
    *   Time spend on executing Lua callbacks callbacks time set by functions such as `render.on()` is measured;
    *   Calling `ac.store('key', false)` clears out a value to fix compatibility with some cars (please keep it mind it’s only meant to store strings or numbers though);
*   WeatherFX:
    *   `ac.setWeatherLightsRangeFactor()`: override default range multiplier based on lights intensity multiplier;
    *   `ac.useMinDepthResolution()`: change the way depth buffer MSAA is resolved depending on what you want to use it for;
*   State API:
    *   Cars timing and sectors related info in car states online fixed;
    *   `ac.getSim().currentSessionTime` and `ac.getSession().hasAdditionalLap` fixed in online races;
    *   New `ac.getCarPhysics().wheels[].discCoreTemperature` for custom physics brakes;
    *   New `ac.getSim().isLinearColorSpaceActive` for active linear color space fix;
    *   New `ac.getSim().currentVAOMode` for current VAO debugging state;
    *   New `ac.getSim().cameraJumped` will be set to `true` for a first frame after camera has been teleported;
    *   New `ac.getSim().isMakingScreenshot` will be set to `true` if currently accumulating frames for a screenshot;
*   New shared libraries (to avoid standard library to grow too massive and slow down scripts loading, extra functions are being added like this instead):
    *   `shared/sim/ghost`: create new ghosts, reload them live and more;
    *   `shared/utils/chat`: share setups in chat, change car color;
    *   `shared/utils/steam`:  access some of Steam API functions;
    *   `shared/utils/appshelf`: any script can use it to ask user to install a trusted app;
    *   `shared/utils/binary`: effortless and fast reading and writing binary data;
    *   `shared/utils/playing`: override info about currently playing music, for example, if your app is playing something;
*   Lua apps:
    *   New `ac.setWindowBackground()` for changing background color and optionally painting titles black;
    *   New `DARK_HEADER` flag for windows if background used is white (title text and icons will be black);
    *   New `itemValues: number[]` field for `ac.getSetupSpinners()` for CSP entries using LUTs;
*   UI & scene API:
    *   `ac.SceneReference:ensureMaterialsUnique()` shouldn’t leak or cause crashes anymore;
    *   `ui.renderShader()` respects IMGUI clip area;
    *   `ui.addSettings()` uses name if ID is not set, for more reliable state saving;
    *   New `ui.onChat()` allowing to replace entire chat app;
    *   `ui.onExclusiveHUD()` can return 'apps' to let CSP know it can draw IMGUI apps;
    *   Experimental functions `ui.pushAlignment()` and `ui.popAlignment()` for aligning UI without usual complications;
    *   Dumped shader replacements, or replacements collected from a KN5 file, no longer affect CSP functional shaders (such as wipers) by adding a new `LEAVE_FUNCTIONAL_SHADERS=1` parameter to config entries;
    *   `ui.MediaPlayer`: FMOD integration improved (but the option is still hidden), unloading media works better;
    *   New `render.BlendMode.OpaqueForced` (overriding disabled opaque blending for transparent passes) and `render.DepthMode.WriteOnly` values;
*   Physics AI API: assign a new spline for a certain AI car (experimental);
*   FFB post-processing scripts: new `ac.disableLowSpeedFFBReduction()`, just in case;
*   `ac.ControlButton:setDisabled()`: AC hotkeys can be disabled as well (at least some of them);
*   `car::kn5::…` textures should work fine with encrypted cars now;
*   Encoded Lua canvases should be readable by ImageMagick;
*   Small chance of a fatal crash on Lua script unload (if it was using logging or something like that in any disposing functions) fixed;
*   Car physics scripts are better compatible with AC locking car controls.
