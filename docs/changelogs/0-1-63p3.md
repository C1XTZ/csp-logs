# Changelog

## New features, options and improvements

*   I reworked rain drops on car exterior again, now those streaming drops use a texture generated with a different approach, to keep things more tidy and stable. Might help a bit with performance too.
*   Brand new per-vertex rain occlusion baking during loading (for now without caching, and it might need more adjustments; also, it bakes models as they load, and driver models load first, so for now they donâ€™t get occluded properly, will work on that).
