*   Trees: LOD padding fixed, surface synchronization no longer uses GrassFX surfaces as fallback, option to offset models vertically so that surface synchronization could still be used.

## Lua & Python

*   Lua scripts get correct track ID even if track ID set in `race.ini` doesn’t match the online one;

*   A bunch of new functions for controlling AI from car physics script;
*   New `physics.blockTeleportingToPits()`, might be useful for certain online scripts;
