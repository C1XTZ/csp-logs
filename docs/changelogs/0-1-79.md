# Changelog

## New features, options and improvements

*   ExtraFX update:
    *   SSLR: various fixes and tweaks, lower resolution tracing improved, new quality levels including Hi-Z tracing (expensive, but produces best results);
    *   SSAO (poor implementation) removed until further improvement;
    *   SSGI removed for good;
    *   Instead, added a new view-independent effect for cars to reflect intense light on the ground around them;
    *   Emissive meshes can cast light on surrounding geometry (currently needs a car or track config);
*   Brake Disc FX:
    *   Rim silhouette is used for more accurate reflection and occlusion;
    *   Few fixes to improve compatibility with various cars;
*   New system for adding hundreds of thousands of trees and smaller bushes to tracks:
    *   So far it’s not procedural and requires track creators to provide tree models in a new format (docs are coming soon);
    *   Trees can be 3D or billboards;
    *   With heavy use of instancing and other optimization techniques tens or hundreds of trees can be added without an issue;
    *   VAO integration is fully supported: new trees both cast shadows and receive ambient shadows from scene and other trees;
*   Original AC heat shimmer updated (optional):
    *   Taking into account wind and temperature;
    *   Spawning more with flames and overheated brakes;
    *   Configurable per car;
    *   Tracks can add similar effect to bonfires and such (already included in `particles_track.ini`);
*   New AI behaviour: optional rubberbanding (makes cars in front of you slower and cars behind faster);
*   Scenery lighting hack for old shaders: now sunsets should keep the track brighter, with more PBR-like look (set by WeatherFX script);
*   Reflections in car rims are occluded using shadowed wheels module;
*   Default weather: improved lighting, adjustments for fog;
*   Option to stop Escape button from exiting replays;
*   Experimental option to improve loading speed;
*   Improved shaders loading (should reduce microstutters);
*   New controls button for pausing the race compatible with steering wheels and gamepads (uses Start button by default if nothing else has been selected);
*   PS5 DualSense support (light bar, LEDs, pad, new API for Gamepad FX allowing to access acceleration, gyroscope and apply resistance to triggers);
*   Control Tweaks app can change gamepad buttons live (useful with DualSense controllers);
*   Car Mirrors Configurator app now allows for a more precise adjustment;
*   New CSP apps now store their position and size across different desktops;
*   Real Mirrors: `VR lock` option is compatible with `Alter FOV` now;
*   Option for adding MIPs to rear view mirrors to reduce aliasing (enabled by default);
*   Small Tweaks: option to turn driver head with free and orbit cameras;
*   Some protection from cheating online;
*   Improved errors handling.

## Fixes

*   Neck FX: better behaviour for large drifting angles;
*   New spectators causing shadows flickering in distance fixed;
*   A few issues with AC Pro compatibility fixed;
*   A lot of fixes for wind speed and direction (now properly aligned in the world, correct speed shown in session details, etc.);
*   Chat shortcuts no longer stop working in some conditions;
*   Android Auto: radio app fixed;
*   Advanced culling braking blurred rims should be fixed now;
*   CSP render stats remain opened across sessions;
*   AC would no longer crash if `cameras.ini` in car data is missing or malformed;
*   Few bugs causing issues with Paintshop app fixed;
*   Skidmarks FX unload properly when disabled;
*   Exhaust flames are much more shortlived for most part now;
*   A couple of fixes for custom physics related to AI and overall stability;
*   Better support for custom online servers;
*   AC motion blur is better compatible with FSR now;
*   Mesh splitting crashes fixed;
*   Optimized reflections rendering fixed;
*   Slight freezes related to Skidmarks FX at the start of the race fixed;
*   Live conditions online now wouldn’t break physics despite values given by server;
*   Smaller fixes and improvements.

## Configs and such:

*   New server options:
    *   A Mumble link for an optional automatic connection (also, optionally closing Mumble when exiting AC);
    *   Slipstream effectiveness multiplier;
*   Car configs now can override position and orientation of car audio sources as well;
*   Car data can have alternative entries for CSP;
*   Update for the new PBR shader: UV1 scaling, option to use unscaled UV1 as UV2, micro shadow and AO fresnel, multilayer version acting the same as classic shader;
*   WeatherFX: option for setting distant ambient lighting shift;
*   Car configs: wobbling nodes now can affect several objects with a single section, especially helpful with LODs;
*   Car skins now can include extra UV2 patches;
*   New headless mode for only running AC physics part with few extra tweaks;
*   Override the name of AC data folder in documents or name of race configuration file (`race.ini`) with environment variables;
*   Skidmarks FX: option to dump skidmarks in a OBJ file;
*   New `AABB_RANGE` parameter for track lights for a small performance improvement;
*   Car data: override grip multiplier for AI;
*   Track meshes split with `[SPLIT_MESHES_...]` are selectable now;
*   Some crashes happening with configs like mesh splitting fixed;
*   Car and track lights, if configured for this, can be disabled if Extra FX bounced light is active properly;
*   CSP looks for car config in car data as well (`data/csp_config.ini`);
*   `CAR_ACTIVE_…` track conditions and garage doors work online properly now;
*   Custom AI: access to data if car wheels are on the valid track surface or not, teleportation direction fixed.

## Lua

*   Access car headlights color and turning lights active phase in car state, sky, sun and fog color in sim state;
*   String splitting function fixed for a case where delimiter is longer than a single symbol;
*   Use TTS with a shared library;
*   New shared UI library for simplified creation of large virtualized lists;
*   Lua modes and online scripts can change audio reverb value;
*   Lua apps: add notification counter, check if window is collapsed, control mouse position, simulate clicks and mouse wheel, alter timezone and geo coordinates live;
*   Physics API (for example, available to online scripts): limit use of DRS, toggle DRS, disable car collisions, changing driver name fixed;
*   Custom physics scripts: change final gear ratio, change or replace turbos with custom implementation, access dynamic controllers, create custom setup menu items and more;
*   Standard library: load and use regular LUTs with optional cubic interpolation;
*   Extended car state: access to gear ratios and values shown by default developer Wings app;
*   Audio: play regular files (WAV, MP3, FLAC, etc.) in 3D space with FMOD (also, now you can start audio events not waiting for audio engine to load);
*   Refresh state of `sim.isAdmin` flag;
*   Bug with lua apps getting unloaded without `LAZY = FULL` option fixed;
*   Online servers now have an option to require Lua scripts to load, shutting down AC if for some reason they aren’t available;
*   Optional periodic live refresh for online servers (clients would re-download scripts every N seconds and refresh their state if scripts have changed);
*   API function for changing driver names live fixed;
*   Crash with several online scripts drawing HUD at once fixed;
*   Bug with extra car audio sources lagging behind car fixed;
*   ERS/KERS values fixed, also a new shared library for accessing config tyre values more easily;
*   Loading LUT from INI config is now working for AC packed data.
