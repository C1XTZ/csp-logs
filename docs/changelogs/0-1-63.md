# Changelog

Rain is not here yet, but it’s almost ready, its visual part is pretty much finished now. Just a few more things left. As for this update, mainly it’s a lot of fixes, but there are some new features too:

*   New screen-space ambient occlusion mode, ASSAO;
*   New shader for tyre grooves with improved look and oil spills for cars with broken engines (will be used automatically);
*   New more accurate sky shader for Weather FX;
*   Clutch is recorded in replays;
*   Accumulation DOF;
*   New photo app: slider for ƒ-number to adjust DOF intensity;
*   Back to four wiper modes by default for modern cars;
*   Maximum amount of lights working simultaneously is increased slightly;
*   Better shadows for accumulation screenshots, with a bit of accurate distance-based blur;
*   Tyres FX: reflection occlusion, to reduce reflectiveness under wheel arches;
*   Option to start the race with throttle pedal, right trigger or associated button (in GUI section);
*   A couple of options to improve FPS limiter behaviour (in General section).

## Fixes

*   SSLR blurring fixed;
*   Refraction breaking after taking a screenshot fixed;
*   Most objects turning black in certain places on some tracks fixed;
*   Mirage and atmosphere distortion now don’t fade away that much with cars driving by;

*   Fake Shadows FX fixed: no more weird offsets for wheels, no more missing shadows (hopefully);
*   Weather FX issue with brighter sky in reflections fixed;
*   Tyres FX fixed;
*   Few issues with extended physics, including the problem with P13c, fixed;
*   Reduced flicker with refraction;
*   Clipping issues with Graphics Adjustments in VR fixed;
*   No more offline cars on that new radar app;
*   Issue with smoke rendered above windscreen without Extra FX fixed;
*   Crashes and various glitches related to shader replacement fixed;

*   Issue with normal map with `ksMultilayer_fresnel_nm_ps` fixed;
*   New name tags function properly online;
*   Few other performance and stability issues fixed.

## For new content and configs

*   Shader stFlow is now included thanks to @Stereo;
*   Improved tyres shader with an option to use txNormal’s alpha channel as a roughness map;
*   Now it’s possible to combine navigators, car stereos and analog odometers within a single mesh (a lot of new extensions for dynamic textures in cars are coming soon);
*   New `FALLBACK_BASE_COLOR` and `FALLBACK_IDLE_COLOR` options for custom emissives;
*   New `DEPTH_MODE` value, `NORMAL_FORCED`, which can override `READ_ONLY` behaviour for transparent meshes;
*   ABS input for car instruments returns actual mode instead of simply being 0 or 1;
*   Mesh filter keywords `alphaBlend:no` and `alphaTest:no` now work;
*   New object filter keywords: `driverPiece:yes` for things within driver model;
*   PBR glass shader now has an option for blurring things behind it, great for edges on glass of open wheelers;
    *   Also, it now has an option for edge detection, finding edges facing a certain point;
*   Masking pass (the one for colored glass) now works with windscreen shader;
*   Normals smoothing now can be applied to physics meshes as well (normals don’t affect physics anyway);
*   Minor navigator update with new controls and a new navigator theme `[Navigator_StyleNavitel]`;
*   Shader `ksPerPixelAT_NM` now has an option for light bouncing back;
*   Windows shader (with fake interior lights) got an option for a bit of distortion to its reflections and a small fix for when it’s viewed from above;
*   Double reload on config change should happen less now;
*   New `bannerMode` option for `ksWindscreen`, perfect for tinted glass or banners;
*   New `MOVE_IN_FRONT` option for `NODE_ADJUSTMENT`;
*   A bit of backlit and boost for dynamic lights for trees and grass shaders;
*   Carved look for new brake disks shader is more noticeable;
*   New `ac.setGlareBloomLuminanceGamma()` function for Weather FX.
