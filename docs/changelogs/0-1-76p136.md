*   Masking pass shading improved, doesn’t look as messy with darker textures, new parameters;
*   Custom car physics:
    *   Create hidden car setup items linked to some AC physics controller (for example, to create a suspension with ride height adapting to car speed);
    *   Link clutch damage to exceedingly high torque;
    *   Create extra links for any suspension, linking together hubs or attaching hubs to body with distance or fixed joints;
    *   New inputs for dynamic physics controllers: `DAMAGE_ENGINE`, `DAMAGE_GEARBOX` (0 for original, 1 for fully damaged);
*   Custom track physics:
    *   Soft walls fixed, with new `MAX_DEPTH` option to limit softness for collisions that are too deep (docs are coming);
    *   Cars spawned aligned to track surface (optional, controlled by track’s physics config surfaces.ini, enabled by default with custom track physics);
*   Deformable track walls for deep collisions (with soft colliders), for tyre walls and such;
*   TyresFX:
    *   New `DIRT_OFFSET_K` parameter, similar to `DAMAGE_OFFSET_K`;
    *   Option to set custom meshes for different tyres;

    *   New mode `COPY_FLIPPED` to fix missing interior windows;
    *   New `INSERT_TO` option to specify new parent for new meshes;
*   Parameter `[BOUNCED_LIGHT] AMBIENT_MULT=0.2` for reducing ambient effect on bounced light now that new VAO patches for tracks have light bounces;

*   New car instrument inputs for KERS;
*   Extra car switches (those extra A/B/C/D functions):
    *   New extra E and extra F switches are added;
    *   Switches now can have a name set in config to show in car description during loading;
    *   Optionally, switch can operate in hold mode (active while button is pressed);

*   Macro `CustomEmissive_UseDiffuseAlpha` fixed, now can use alpha from txDiffuse;
*   If you’re using wing animations to show and hide extra bits, now you can configure it so `hidden` geometry would actually be hidden, saving draw calls:
    *   Car lights now can be bound to wing states, referencing wing ID and using LUT for brightness multiplier;
    *   For simple cases with two states where hidden bit is either scaled down or moved far away, CSP should be able to guess things automatically;
    *   Tool to quickly generate such animations with corresponding config is available on CSP wiki;
*   When copying coordinates from Objects Inspector, hold Shift for additional precision;

    *   New I/O functions `io.exists()`, `io.load()` and `io.save()` (only for scripts that would have access to I/O);
    *   Load and store typed values with `ac.storage` (could be used to access string values based on keys or, for faster access, create localized holders);
    *   `ac.load(key)` returns nil if no value with such key was stored before;
    *   More functions to access more details about simulation state like type names, driver names and nationalities, etc.;
    *   Lua scripts being unable to find referenced files nearby fixed;

    *   Access mirror texture to create displays with rear view camera and overlays;
    *   Define new cameras (similar to rear view mirror) with optional post-processing and access them in script, for this like parking camera activating with reverse gear;

    *   Change car state: switch headlights, high beams and extra toggles;
    *   Control some of car inputs: alter ABS, TC, brake bias, turbo wastegate, engine brake, etc. (could be used to create a dashboard similar to one of BMWs with extra car settings);
