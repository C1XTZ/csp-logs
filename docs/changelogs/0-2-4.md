*   Automatic shadow splits no longer take FOV into account for interior shots, splits are shown in LightingFX app;
*   `[CUSTOM_PHYSICS] EXTRAPOLATE_STATE = 1` for online servers is removed (please set to 0 anyway if your servers require CSP newer than 2784, to fix issues with 0.2.3);
*   Dust particles keep their colors for longer;

*   Taskbar icons are positioned in a more stable way to prevent flickering;
*   A bunch of fixes for random crashes when editing configs and such;
*   Distant headlights glare is removed for now until I’ll redo it in a way that doesn’t rely on cars having accurate headlight light source placement;

*   Gamepad and keyboard keyboard bindings ignore presses if keyboard modifiers are pressed (apart from gear up/down and handbrake for keyboard controls, in case somebody would use Ctrl, Alt or Shift for - gas or brakes); wheel keyboard bindings should already filter out those presses;
*   Toggling replay mode or seeking its time bar marks cars as jumped preventing some issues with animated entities;
