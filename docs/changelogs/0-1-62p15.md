## New features, options and improvements

*   Raindrops on windscreen now enabled by default, using XAtlas instead of UVAtlas for better and more stable windows mapping (plus it should solve all possible issues with Windows 7), wipers work even if FPS is not 65, drops shading on mirrors improved with a bit of occlusion to add some shape, layers fixed (now, if there are any semi-opaque areas on windscreen, they’ll remain under raindrops).
*   Raindrops on car exteriors reworked, with secondary layer of smaller droplets, which is linked to car wetness estimation instead of rain shadow as main layer (which was causing cars to instantly dry out in tunnels).
*   Initial attempt to guess exterior and interior materials instead of relying on COCKPIT_HR (the whole idea is sort of failed though, now I’m going to try and add some one time rain occlusion baking instead; rearranged the way shaders work so now it allows to feed more data per vertex to GPU without increasing RAM or VRAM consumption).
*   Look of rain drops in the air adjusted, they’re not as opaque now. Let me know what you think about them, please.
*   A few crashes are fixed now.
