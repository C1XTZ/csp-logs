    *   Improved modifiers keys processing (releasing a modifier before the main button no longer triggers a binding with that button without a modifier);
    *   High beams activating without low beams when switch is held, or for AC lights flash button for cars without flashing lights;
    *   Alt+Enter with DXGI flip model disabled restores old window position and style (disabled by default);

## Physics
*   Added cphys ABS (similar to cphys TC in features but more complex and flexible, docs are coming soon);
*   CSP Logger:
    *   Added gear ratio channel;
    *   Brake torque and pressure channels now include ABS intervention;
    *   Added brake line pressures pre-ABS (front and rear);
    *   Added ERS and KERS state of charge (SoC) channels;
    *   Added electric torque (per wheel) channels;
    *   Added lap progression channel (shows percentage of the way through lap based on AI line);
    *   Added ABS Setting channel;
    *   Added many ABS debug channels (cphys ABS only);
    *   Slip Ratio channels are clamped to −1000–1000 range to avoid data precision losses when values approach infinity after dividing by zero velocity;
    *   Removed test channels left over from initial development;
    *   Axle torque channels have correct indices and also more appropriately show axle torque vs. previously showing something more along the lines of feedback torque;
    *   First lap in hotlap mode logs correctly;
    *   Fixed units of rev limiter channel;
    *   G-force channels all clamped to avoid bit precision issues with teleports or huge crashes;
    *   Added brake balance bar position channel for cars using MCs;
    *   Tightened up channels displayed for encrypted cars;
    *   Added damper lengths (kinematic, don’t include installation stiffness effects);
    *   Reduced default log rates and added another log rate category to help with file size;
*   Added brake master cylinder pressure computation and setup options (evolution of realfeel implementation);
*   Rewrote automatic cutoff logic for shifting (no longer cuts via `gas`, is a full electronic cut instead);
*   Cphys turbo added functionality, allows for exhaust flow to be present (to maintain boost pressure) even if throttle is being cut by TC, shift cut, or limiter (very different from vanilla, now can use more realistic lag times);
*   Rewrote `TORQUE_MODE_EX=2` to be more accurate under combined engine and brake torque cases (includes ABS effect as well, so may be more noticeable via the FFB with how violently vanilla ABS responds);
*   Cosmic suspension: `CARPOS` works for ball joints, distance joints, steer joint, and hinges;
*   New physics experiment awakening car in pits for easier setup (with alternative option for disabling tyre grip entirely and instead holding the car in place using a specialized prismatic+universal joint);
*   `Disable autobraking` experiment replaced with a new one (compatible with old one), with more modes;
*   Wheels repair thing updated to be more conservative (and can be disabled in car data);
*   A couple of small bugs in original AWD1 code are fixed if custom physics is enabled (axle torques should no longer oscillate when differential is locking, while average torque should remain the same);
*   New `[_EXTENSION] SUPPORTS_MANUAL_CUTOFF=1` for `drivetrain.ini`;
*   Add `[_EXTENSION] REPAIR_WHEELS=0` to `suspensions.ini` to stop CSP from fixing flipped suspensions entirely;
*   New `[_EXTENSION] MESH_OFFSET=X, Y, Z` in `colliders.ini` for cars with extended physics just in case;
*   New `[_EXTENSION] RIM_SPRING_RATE=8000000 RIM_DAMPING_RATE=80000` in `tyres.ini` to configure rim-ground collisions;
*   Add `[_EXTENSION] DISALLOW_SURFACESFX=1` to `tyres.ini` to disable Surfaces FX for the car entirely (not recommended);
*   CSP can recognize `None` as an empty setup hint item value as well;
*   If `disable autobraking` is disabled, cars will wait for 250 frames to fall asleep instead of 50 frames in original AC (750 ms instead of 150 ms).

## Fixes

    *   IMGUI glow no longer gets stops with any popup;
    *   Toasts (those popup messages in the bottom left corner) closing (by dragging them aside) improved;

    *   New `[AUDIO] DISABLE_FALLBACK_TURN_SIGNAL=0/1` to specify if default turn signal audio should be used at all or not (also, CSP sets `state` when playing specialized turn sign audio from car soundbank, 0.1 for switching on, 0.6 for switching off);
    *   A second value to `BIND_TO_HEADLIGHTS` to explicitly specify if light should be active or not if it’s headlights flashing without low beams: `BIND_TO_HEADLIGHTS=1, INCLUDING_HIGHBEAMS_FLASH` or `EXCLUDING_HIGHBEAMS_FLASH`;

    *   `ac.onSetupsListRefresh()` is available to all scripts, just in case;

    *   Car physics scripts can create `ac.ReplayStream()` for render car scripts to access, so that data transferred from physics to rendering is automatically stored in replays, car ID and index will be added to the key automatically;
    *   Hub index argument for `ac.addTorque()`;
    *   Car physics scripts: use `ac.overrideSpecificValue(ac.CarPhysicsValueID.ForcelessTyres, true, …)` to stop any forces from a tyre;
*   Gameplay API:
    *   New `ac.applyContentConfig()` for reloading cars and track config live even if live reloads are disabled;
    *   New `ac.highlightCar()` function adding extra glow to a car model;
*   Lua apps:
    *   Use `ac.applyLiveConfigEdit('general.ini', '[DEV] NANORT_SCENE_RAYCAST=1')` to spend a bunch of RAM, but increase scene raycasting speed a lot (first raycast might be slow due to building of accelerating structures);
    *   New parameter for `ac.setTrackCoordinatesDeg()` allowing to override heading angle as well;
    *   `ac.setPhysicsDebugLines()`: a flag for cosmic bodies;
    *   `ac.ReplayStream()`:
    *   Fix for special types such as `half` and `unorm8`;
    *   If several scripts use the same `ac.ReplaySteam()`, it’ll act as `ac.connect()` (sharing frame directly);
    *   Optional argument for reduced record rate;
    *   New `[CORE] LIVE_RELOAD` to specify mask for files which trigger app reload (for example, `LIVE_RELOAD='{ ( ?.lua|?.fx|?.hlsl|?manifest.ini ) & ! plugins/? }'` will exlude plugins folder from reloading the app);
    *   New `SETUP_INLINE` flag windows allowing them to integrate into the new main menu;
    *   New functions for dealing with voting: `ac.castVote()`, `ac.canCastVote()`, `ac.getCurrentVoteDetails()`, `ac.timeToNextVote()`;
*   New `ac.ScriptResumeCondition.Collision` for car scripts (both physics and regular);
*   `physics.disableCarCollisions()` got an argument to alter collisions of remote cars online;
*   New `physics.setTyresCompound()` for some very special cases;
*   Lua apps: editing repair pits settings has been fixed;
*   Changing nothing but mirror position or direction using `ac.setRealMirrorParams()` should work now;
*   New parameter for `ac.setRealMirrorParams()` allowing for car scripts to stop apps such as Mirror Configurator and fully override mirror params (use it if you want your monitor rear view mirror to change FOV, position or direction);
*   Changing monitor brightness using `ac.setRealMirrorParams()` should work;
*   Real mirrors functions, as well as a few other car-controlling functions, can function during replays;
*   A rare issue with Lua event listeners getting cancelled a couple of seconds after a script reload fixed;
*   `ac.flashLight()` fixed;
*   Issue with car scripts failing to reload if `script.update()` is not present fixed;
*   A small tweak to get IMGUI to use main font (with CJK characters) as a fallbac if selected font doesn’t have a required glyph (not that nice, but better than nothing);
*   Removing windscreen meshes using Lua Scene API shouldn’t crash AC anymore;
*   Lua Debug app: used memory is measured for all apps, main tab layout updated;
*   Docs for `io.load()` fixed.
