    *   Option for sun shadows to affect road temperature;
    *   Car body flex (needs to be configured in car data);
    *   Karts can allow drivers to shift weight using VR headset, IR tracking or extra buttons;
*   Controls and FFB:
    *   All wheel axis, not just brakes, have configurable gamma;
    *   New alternative soft-lock implementation working with any steering wheel which should be smoother and less bouncy;
    *   Option to create FFB post-processing scripts using Lua;
    *   Optional FFB effect adding vibrations for dirty tyres (disabled by default);
*   Apps:
    *   Integrated Mumble client allowing to add voice chat to online servers with ease, without users having to install anything extra;
    *   New App Shelf app containing a bunch of additional apps you can install directly from Assetto Corsa (some apps were moved there):

        *   Controller Tweaks: configure steering wheels, gamepads and keyboard controls live, change FFB and gamepad buttons;
        *   Flashlight: a tiny tool adding a bit of light to camera to help configure things;
        *   Paintshop: draw directly on cars and tracks using mouse or a pencil;
        *   Pocket Technician: edit car setup live in offline practice sessions;
        *   Radar: see nearby cars from above;

        *   Web Browser: browse web and pin webpages as new apps;
        *   New built-in CSP Debug app for tweaking few things or, for example, dragging car around in practice sessions;
        *   New `View & Settings` app allowing to edit some graphics settings live;
*   WeatherFX:
    *   Styles can replace YEBIS post-processing entirely for improved looks and performance;
    *   Default style visuals updated;
    *   Default style got a lightweight YEBIS alternative so you wouldn’t have to disable post-processing anymore;
*   WindscreenFX: option for proper dynamic reflections in the windshield;
*   ExtraFX: triple screen support;
*   BrakeDiscFX: when available, physics temperature is used for glow instead of approximation;
*   NeckFX: use Lua script instead of that old implementation, helmet rendering option got a major rework;
*   Smart Mirrors: option for lower refresh rate with reprojection to keep things smooth and speed things up;
*   Few updates for auto-pilot (Ctrl+C), original behaviour can be restored with a setting in General settings group;
*   Option to reorder entries in AC leaderboard (F9) by real-time race positions;
*   Option to render UI on top of other HUD elements;
*   A lot of new tonemapping functions for post-processing, including ability to create custom ones;
*   Photo mode: tilt-shift lens simulation allowing to twist focus plane in different ways, support for `.CUBE` tonemapping;
*   Steam integration for screenshots;
*   Render scale option for better performance and UI scaling on high-dpi screens;
*   Improved DualSense and DualShock support: LEDs, gyroscope steering, haptic feedback and more;
