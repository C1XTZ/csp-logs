## Changelog

*   New built-in app to profile Python apps performance;
*   New Python functions:
    *   `ac.ext_isAppVisible("app name")`: easily skip whole `acUpdate()` if app is not enabled and there is no need to do any background work;
    *   `ac.ext_perfBegin("name")`/`ac.ext_perfEnd("name")`: measure time in-between those calls and get it right there in milliseconds (new profile app will show it too);
*   Custom smoke:
    *   A couple of fixes for unnecessary spawn for front wheels with high camber;
    *   Adjusted look and behaviour;
    *   New culling to improve performance;
    *   Option to render smoke downscaled to improve performance (doesn’t look good and only available when soft particles are working);
    *   Better compatibility with TAA;
    *   Dust color now synced with track’s dust color;
    *   Fixed compatibility with VR and triple screen;
*   Pieces particles:
    *   Size and quantity adjusted;
    *   Collisions detection improved;
    *   Work better without Grass FX (grass would only fly off on grass, colors are synced too);
*   Light map:
    *   Emissive is also included;
*   TAA:
    *   Stencil-based anti-ghosting for moving and translucent objects;
    *   Motion-based anti-ghosting;
    *   Halton sequence for sampling;
    *   Adjustable spread;
    *   Anti-ghosting clamping replaced by clipping to preserve colors;
    *   Various fixes;
*   SSGI fixed;
*   HBAO+ uses normal map for smoother results;
*   SSAO/HBAO+ no longer affect reflections (that looked bad);
*   SSLR:
    *   Blurring improved;
    *   Takes colored reflections into account;
    *   Blending fixed;
*   Spectators and original particles work properly with TAA and motion blur;
*   Motion blur on medium quality fixed;
*   Custom setup items work better with non-English locales;
*   Controls for gear ratios fixed;
*   Objects inspector app:
    *   Missing names fixed;
    *   Button to remove selection;
    *   Shows material properties as well;
*   Cornering lamps fixed;
*   Tyres pressure indicators fixed;
*   AI flood fixed;
*   Patch can forcefully disable TC with keyboard controls;
*   Triple screen uses correct FOV for adjustable things like shadow and clipping distances;
*   Grass compatibility with triple screen and VR fixed;
*   Rare issue with triple screen and transparent objects fixed;
*   GPU time measurement in debug apps no longer slows things down;
*   Defined bounding box in car’s config won’t break collider mesh for Particles FX and Grass FX.
