# Changelog

*   Refracting car lights:
    *   Position auto-guessing;
    *   Option for custom bulbs position;
    *   Option for emissive multi-channel behavior;
    *   Performance improvements comparing to preview builds;
    *   Multi-sampling option (increasing cost in four times, so, don’t use it unless it’s really needed);
*   New multi-channel emissive shaders:
    *   New alternative mode for txEmissive in which each texture channel defines a mask for a certain emissive channel;
    *   Optional procedural mode with four ways of defining areas;
    *   Two types of mirroring allowing to increase amount of channels for symmetrical meshes from 4 to 7;
    *   New shader for dashboards allowing to set up to 25 indicators with a single mesh and material (procedural mode only);
    *   New shader with both `_emissive` and digital screen features, using emissive mask as digital screen mask as well;
    *   New PBR glass shader with `_emissive` features;
    *   Car emissives can specify emissive channel directly, tracks can use `ksEmissive1` (`ksEmissive2` and so on) syntax;
    *   Refracting car lights can use proceducally defined light bulbs linked to different channels:
        1. [https://gfycat.com/deficientfondhorseshoecrab](https://gfycat.com/deficientfondhorseshoecrab); (Has been deleted)
        2. Please use this approach instead of dynamic emissive map! That feature might be removed soon.
*   Procedural grass reworked:
    *   Now with geometric fins;
    *   Fully customizable cascades;
    *   Cars move grass when driving by;
    *   For now, without parameters, that will be returned back soon;
*   New Python functions:
    *   Everything reworked using more error-prone approach, fixing a few bugs in the process;
    *   If you’ll notice any incompatibilities in API, please let me know, will fix asap;
    *   Switch to strict mode to get errors if arguments are wrong, instead of patch silently returning default value as it was doing before;
    *   Python profiler app now also shows log and error messages, renamed to `Python Apps Debug`;
    *   Profiling and error handling for Python apps now should work within extra callbacks as well;
*   PBR shaders updated:
    *   Specular ambient added (temporary solution until I’ll figure out how to do it properly);
    *   Works properly with dynamic lights;
    *   Overly occluded reflections fixed;
    *   New option for txDetailNormal in PBR format, containing normals, occlusion and specular level (inverted roughness);
*   Lights guessing now would work with a single mesh for all four turning indicators;
*   Dynamic navigators;
*   INIpp format updated:
    *   Breaking change: indices now start with 1 instead of 0, to make it less awkward when working with expressions (which were already using 1 because of Lua);
    *   New features:
        1. Generators;
        2. Refer to mixins anywhere, with inline parameters and optional shorter syntax;
        3. Auto-indexing values;
        4. Vectors support;
    *   A lot of bugfixes;
    *   Twice as fast;
    *   Now with automatic tests to ensure new features won’t break anything!
    *   For more information, check out INIpp repo and its README;
*   Includable configs with templates:
    *   New `custom_emissive.ini` allowing to set turning lights and what not in just a couple of lines;
    *   New `selflighting.ini` helping to speed up a bit adding extra light sources for headlights lighting up the car;
    *   Glass: brightness adjustment option, option to use normal map and, if needed, to use alpha-channel from normal map;
    *   Car paints: tiling fix is now optional, use `ApplyTilingFix = 0` to disable it;
    *   Interior PBR materials: new `Material_LeatherDetailed` template with PBR detail texture, new options;
    *   A lot of new stuff for navigators;
*   Extra FX: new `MASK_GBUFFER` option for headlights glass, allowing to get local reflections from behind it, but dimmer;
*   Alpha-to-coverage thing rolled back for now;
*   Dirt particles use track colors from Tyres FX, this time properly;
*   A bit of tonemapping for SSLR to reduce aliasing caused by too bright objects being reflected;
*   Analog odometers:
    *   Now background color is used properly;
    *   Use fonts from `content/fonts`;
    *   Options for scaling fonts vertically and for a vertical offset for fonts;
*   Car inputs:
    *   Options `INPUT_ADD` and `INPUT_MULT` (not really needed with `INPUT_LUT`, but it might be easier sometimes to just use a simple way of setting it);
    *   Options `INPUT_THRESHOLD_LOWER_INC` and `INPUT_THRESHOLD_UPPER_INC` using less-or-equal or greater-or-equal check;
    *   New `SEATBELT` input (free camera with hidden driver for now);
*   SSLR works better with semi-transparent objects (not as bad as before) like semi-trasparent puddles with new water shader;
*   Adaptive shadow boundaries now should shift closer if something is very close to camera;
*   New digital screen shader acting like overlay for existing meshes;
*   Option for terrain casting shadows: will cast shadows as double-sided when sun is low;
*   Option for disabling track cameras LOD distance multiplier, enabled by default;
*   Option for filling missing textures in `SHADER_REPLACEMENT_...`;
*   Option to disable side culling;
*   Water shader: option to use alpha-channel from txNormal;
*   Default frequency for blinking emissives changed to 2.2 Hz (apart from turning lights);
*   New car paints got damages and dirt back;
*   Mesh filters in cars: filter by LOD;
*   New options for car lights:
    *   `OFFSET` and `OFF_OFFSET`, three numbers, for fine-tuning position without reassigning guessed value;
    *   `ONESIDED`, either `LEFT` or `RIGHT`: same as setting `MIRROR=0` and `POSITION=X, …`, where X was old `MIRROR` value, but guessing-friendly;
    *   `PREFER_FRONT`, for position guessing (if mesh was split in two bits, front and rear) or picking custom emissive properly;
*   Option to add extra sharpness to local reflections for certain materials or meshes;
*   Custom analog instruments:
    *   `POS_OFFSET_START` and `POS_OFFSET_END` fixed;
    *   Option for scaling with `SCALE_START` and `SCALE_END`;
    *   New `LOWER_BOUND` option;
*   A lot of various fixes and stability improvements.
