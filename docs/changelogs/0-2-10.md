    *   Telemetry tab is recreated as well;
    *   Ctrl+Tab to switch between tabs;
*   New option to hide pit crew of remote players only;

## Fixes

*   `Fully dynamic` pits option stopping cars with axles from moving fixed;
*   Crashes caused by binding turbo, glance and such to D-pads fixed (regression in 0.2.9);
*   CSP previews generation fixed;
*   Recent AC logging rewrite fixed, no longer causes AC to collapse when trying to output long strings;
*   Option to hide pit crew fully is working online;
*   Occasional dead freeze during loading fixed;
*   Autopilot no longer drivers into a wall on a session restart, if the car was in pits before that (and, in general, AIs will switch active pitlane on teleports again based on where they’re ending up);
*   Cars with missing soundbanks should still detect when camera is inside the car (for example, helps windscreen raindrops);
*   New KN5 loader reports missing DLCs properly again;
*   A bunch of bugs with advanced online features on servers with more than 127 cars caused by CSP mistakenly treating session ID as signed fixed;
*   Extra FX: TAA misbehaving on grass (or in other areas with color below 0) fixed;
*   New trees:
    *   Tree definitions are reused when reloading settings and cache some things a bit more intensely, fixing memory leaks and performance issues when using Tree Planter app;
    *   Sun shadows are a lot smoother, self-shadowing reduced;
    *   Shadows and billboads of trees with width above 100% should look better;
    *   Ambient shadow is much smaller and more subtle (for large-scale shadows, please use VAO);
*   New menu:
    *   Holding Alt to drag mirrored sliders fixed (regression in 0.2.9);
    *   Welcome message closes when clicked outside of popup as well;
    *   Exporting lap times as CSV is working (previously was generating an empty CSV);
    *   Sorting by indices fixed;
    *   Voting cooldown no longer applies to `kick` vote, for both new menu and Lua apps API;
*   Walking Out:
    *   Unused cars won’t switch lights automatically anymore;
    *   Headlights range misbehaving when switching cars with free camera fixed;
*   Smart Mirrors:
    *   MIPs are no longer unnecessarily generating several times at once;
    *   Mirrors reflected in mirrors now use cubemap to show something instead of being black;
    *   Frame skipping is paused if camera is moving relative to the car too much;
*   Rain FX:
    *   Rain hits fade with distance;
    *   Rain spray in mirrors should no longer appear inside the car (clip distance increased);
    *   Windscreen UV generation reuses worker threads, should speed up the generation a tiny bit;
*   AIs switching headlights according to Weather FX headlights suggestion should have some variance again;
*   AC no longer spams `DInput input lost:` when controller is lost;
*   IMGUI: symbols `≤` and `≥` added to the glyph atlas;
*   `Skipping LOD A for other cars` option no longer forces Rain FX occlusion rebake;
*   Render Stats app: relative subsections (those horizontal bars under the main graph) are meaningful again;
*   Shading in mirrors without LCS active closer matches the main scene;
*   Spam of log messages about HTTP2 and such is fixed;
*   Custom driver models no longer require LOD B;
*   Android Auto: timer fixed, clicking on the entire status block, not just the icon, opens the app;
*   Windscreen reflection shaders preload, should help to prevent a lag when switching to an interior camera for the first time;
*   CSP reporting errors for CM fixed.

## Configs

*   New car inputs: `AUTO_SHIFTING`, `MANUAL_SPEED_LIMITER`;
*   Emissive shaders, such as `smGlass_emissive`, are compatible with mask pass;
*   New `[_EXTENSION] FORCE_DOUBLESIDED_RAYCASTS=1` for `surfaces.ini` allowing tracks to enable double-sided raycasts for cars without extended physics (recent fix of that messed up some of the tracks);
*   Custom AI:
    *   New `.v1` struct for car control allowing to set extra grip, stabilizer and custom ABS logic;
    *   New field for activating or disabling input smoothing;
    *   New `[DEV] DISABLE_AI_SMOOTH_STEERING` disabling smoothing for Kunos AIs entirely, for debugging purposes.

## Lua

*   Common:
    *   New fields: `ac.getCar().anyFlamesActive`, `ac.getSim().bestLapTimeMs` (global best time), `ac.getSim().isMouseSteeringActive`, `ac.getSim().originShift`;
    *   New `math.simplex()`: a better alternative to `math.perlin()`;
    *   New `ac.areShapesColliding()` allowing to quickly check a couple of shapes (geometric and car colliders) for an intersection;
    *   New `ac.getUnreadChatMessages()` to get the number of unread chat messages;
    *   New `ac.getCarBlindSpot()` returning the distance to the nearest cars in blind zones;
    *   New event listeners `ac.onLapCompleted()`, `ac.onTrackPhysicsObjectCarCollision()` and `ac.onCarColorChanged()`;
    *   `ac.areCarsColliding()` function has been moved to Common API;
    *   Functions `web.get`, `web.post` and such now allow to pin HTTPS certificate or access its fingerprint (matches SHA-256 fingerprint in Firefox);
    *   `web.load…` functions loading remote assets can set headers and pin HTTPS certificate;
    *   Functions `math.saturate()` and `math.clamp()` (as well as …N versions) got a major performance boost, `math.clamp()` can handle a case where one of the limits is a vector and another is a number (an old bug);
    *   Function `table.same()` no longer malfunctions with `false` values in associative tables;
    *   Pass `'deep'` as a second parameter to `table.clone()` to make copies of vectors and colors as well;
    *   Old functions `ac.store()` / `ac.load()` rewritten to be a bit more efficient;
    *   `ac.setHighBeams()` works when binding is in held mode;
    *   Updating friend status with `ac.DriverTags()` and `ac.tagAsFriend()` fixed;
    *   `ac.getSunAngle()` updates online;
    *   `ac.getSim().timeMultipler` is no longer zero online with WeatherFX conditions or a dynamic weather plugin (if time is actually moving);
*   UI:
    *   `ui.setNextItemIcon()` works with `ui.beginMenu()`;
    *   Integrated tab bar: takes window settings button into account, style for the dropdown button updated;
    *   New `ui.beginPointSampler()` / `ui.endPointSampler()` functions to swap IMGUI shader for the one using point sampler;
    *   `ui.keyboardButtonDown()` works with sided buttons, such as left control;
*   Scene API:
    *   Raycasting now takes ray length into account (except for AABB raycasting);
    *   Raycasting with NanoRT acceleration returns correct local position, UV, etc., builds accelerating structures in background;
    *   Removing nodes actively used by ExtraFX emissives shouldn’t crash AC;
*   Physics API:
    *   New `physics.setAIStopCounter()` stopping AIs for some time;
    *   `physics.RigidBody`: collision callback returns car index, if any;
*   IO:
    *   `io.load()` releases file instantly, allowing to delete it after reading, for example;
    *   `io.recycle()` fixed, actually recycles things now;
    *   New `io.findFile()` returning an absolute file path to a file;
    *   Background and physics workers now support relative and absolute paths as well (working script directory will still be the same as the parent’s one);
    *   Workers kept alive by Lua Debug app still release the things they hold, such as event subscriptions, immediately;
    *   `os.runConsoleProcess()`: new `terminateWithScript = 'disposable'` option can be used to get back an `ac.Disposable` instead, also, with that one set to `false` and previously undocumented `assignJob` it’s now possible to get a process to stay alive after AC has been closed;
    *   `io.extractFromZipAsync()`: extra parameter for a crucial file to ensure full extraction (it’ll be extracted last with a different name and then renamed, so your code could simply check the file existance: as long as file is present, it means archive has been extracted in full);
*   `web.loadRemoteAssets()`: option to specify a crucial file name similar to `io.extractFromZipAsync()`, scripts with full I/O access no longer have file type restrictions, plus a bunch of fixes;
*   Lua apps:
    *   New `ac.restartApp()`;
    *   `ac.exportLapTimesToCSV()` is working, got an optional argument to specify filename;
*   New Modes: use `[TWEAKS] HIDE_PITCREW` to hide pit crews entirely;
*   New functions in `shared/sim/cars` for getting and altering base wheel positions for remote cars;
*   `ac.onOpenMainMenu()` can be receive other types of pages, for example, when `ac.tryToOpenRaceMenu()` is called;
*   Lua Debug app:
    *   Option to use point sampler when viewing Lua textures;
    *   App now remembers the selected setting for rendering vectors across script reloads;
*   Docs for some functions and fields updated, Lua plugin by sumneko now properly understands types of CSP’s `table.` functions;
*   LuaJIT synced with upstream (there were some small fixes).
