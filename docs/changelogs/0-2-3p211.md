    *   Sun shadows affecting surface temperature moved to physics experiments section;
    *   Alternative for AC physics threadpool distributing cars computation along cores;

## Extended physics

*   General:
    *   Gyroscopic FFB attenuation on center enabled by default for Cosmic (necessary for pretty much all FFB wheels on the market);
    *   Low speed physics (Sliding Fix) modified;
    *   Kunos cubic interpolation LUTs (tyre load sensitivity and camber LUTs) no longer extrapolate (caused numerous issues for modders over the years including unexplained explosions and game crashes);
*   Cosmic suspension:
    *   Bodies can now be declared for use with KS ARBs (necessary for custom chassis flex to work, otherwise `front` chassis is always used, giving incorrect stiffnesses);
    *   Ball joints got adjustable geometry (syntax the same as distance joints);
    *   Cosmic body flex (when using ARB_BODY) shows up visually (USE_FOR_ARB must be used; it is the flag for the rear chassis body);
    *   Debug lines use exact joint positions;
*   Tyres:
    *   Thermal Model v2 is supported (docs are coming soon);
    *   Better edge-case contact normal calculation (limits contact normals to some threshold from tire radial normal; should avoid strange load spikes and other edge-case phenomena where rays contact the surface strangely);
    *   Option to apply relaxation length to forces instead of slip (add `[_EXTENSION] USE_RELAX_LENGTH_ON_FORCE=1`);
*   Colliders:
    *   Colliders have new wear function available (docs are coming soon);
    *   Lua parameters are accessible (`ALLOW_LUA_RESET=1` per collider lets Lua reset wear individually, e.g. in a pit stop);
*   Suspension:
    *   Damper LUTs display correctly again in the Car Debug app.
*   Brakes:
    *   Brake thermal model considers ABS (same issue in original physics as well, but to ensure backwards compatibility it won’t be fixed; thanks to Tuttertep for report).
