*   State of wings used to hide and show additional car geometry is syncing online now;
*   FSR: 
    *   Whole thing reworked with officially released SDK:
        *   Quality presets are different now;
        *   Recommended level of sharpening is used now;
        *   Option for adjusting MIP bias according to recommendations;
    *   Option to set lower quality setting for left and right sides in triple screen mode;
    *   Optional debug mode: hold Space to quickly switch to simple linear upscaling to compare;
*   Smoke fully reworked (apart from tyres heating and spawning logic):
    *   New improved shading;
    *   Improved smoke-cars collisions;
    *   Better support for open-wheelers;
    *   Tyre smoke spawns below car with extreme drifting angles;
    *   Dust and splashes spawns around car, not just from wheels;
    *   Dust flies off dusty wheels;
    *   A bit of dust appears for some F1 cars with wooden skidpads when those touch the ground (and can be configured on per-collider basis, similar to sparks);
    *   Clouds of dust spawn on collisions;
    *   Smaller particles for bits of dirt and smaller splashes spawn in contact points;
    *   Long-lasting smoke and dust (lasts for several minutes);
    *   When on grass, instead of dust clouds, more subtle soil particles are used (color is set in track config);
    *   New look for smoke from exhaust, heated brakes and damaged engine;
    *   Smoke won’t show up inside a cockpit;
    *   Colored smoke and dust lose saturation with expansion, with new config parameters to adjust the rate;
    *   Smoke culling improved for further optimization and smoother transitions;
    *   New options to adjust density and on-screen size, to balance between visuals and performance;
    *   Extra effect with smoke covering whole screen, to get effect of camera stuck in smoke much cheaper;
*   Pieces particles update:
    *   Adjusted types chances, size and shading;
    *   Collision detection now uses car heightmaps instead of depth buffer for more accurate results;
*   Size of sparks particles fixed, sparks no longer spawn with head-on collisions;
*   TyresFX: 
    *   Grass and dirt on tyres reworked, textures and rendering both;
    *   Soil color is taken into account;
*   GrassFX:
    *   Active ExtraFX pass option now properly supports fake car shadows reprojection;
    *   Grass deformation updated, now takes into account grass height;
    *   If you’re using original AC motion blur, it would affect grass as well now;

*   Specify joypad index for joypads input mode;
*   Support for VAO patches v5 with spatial AO samples for dynamic objects;
*   New sky mesh with more evenly distributed triangles for better reflections and mirrors;
*   Option to hide console;
*   Option to create portals to other servers online for freeroam servers;
*   Scene tweaks from new photo mode app remain active in replay with app hidden;
*   If VR failed to initialize, there’ll be a warning on loading screen (especially helpful if you accidentally chose wrong render mode);
*   Similar warning would be shown if ExtraFX would fail to initialize because of AC motion blur;
*   Chat shortcuts reworked: new UI system, now don’t trigger change in turbo, different approach for alternative set of messages;
*   Option to unbind digit buttons from changing turbo level;
*   Triple screen tweaks: option to always show driver name tags (with original system);
*   Semi-transparent shadows from smoke, flames, semi-transparent objects and such improved with Bayer dithering;
*   Button for manual control of speed limiter (with default session settings it would still be automatically engaged in pits, but it could be overriden in some cases);
*   Walking out module: settings, improved transition, few fixes, selected car is the controlled one, tool for positioning cars a bit more easily;
*   Freer camera: use pedals to smoothly control camera speed.

## For new content and configs

*   Override car data files related to visuals, such as `lods.ini` or `lights.ini`, by creating new files in `extension/data_override` folder;
*   Colorful shadowing: overall look improved, new parameters;
*   Masking pass shading improved, doesn’t look as messy with darker textures, new parameters;
*   Custom car physics:
    *   Create hidden car setup items linked to some AC physics controller (for example, to create a suspension with ride height adapting to car speed);
    *   Link clutch damage to exceedingly high torque;
*   Custom track physics:
    *   Soft walls fixed, with new `MAX_DEPTH` option to limit softness for collisions that are too deep (docs are coming);
    *   Cars spawned aligned to track surface (optional, controlled by track’s physics config surfaces.ini, enabled by default with custom track physics);
*   Deformable track walls for deep collisions (with soft colliders), for tyre walls and such;
*   TyresFX:
    *   New `DIRT_OFFSET_K` parameter, similar to `DAMAGE_OFFSET_K`;
    *   Option to set custom meshes for different tyres;
*   `[MESH_SPLIT_...]`: 
    *   Set split name or material directly, or use existing material;
    *   New mode `COPY_FLIPPED` to fix missing interior windows;
    *   New `INSERT_TO` option to specify new parent for new meshes;
*   Parameter `[BOUNCED_LIGHT] AMBIENT_MULT=0.2` for reducing ambient effect on bounced light now that new VAO patches for tracks have light bounces;
*   Parameter `[REFLECTIONS_FX] INTERIOR_NODES=…` for cars without properly set `COCKPIT_HR` now works better, affecting more CSP features;
*   New car instrument inputs for KERS;
*   Extra car switches (those extra A/B/C/D functions):
    *   New extra E and extra F switches are added;
    *   Switches now can have a name set in config to show in car description during loading;
    *   Optionally, switch can operate in hold mode (active while button is pressed);
    *   Optionally, switch can require stationary car to activate (like a speed key for Bugatty Veyron, for example), or neutral gear, or pressed brake pedal;
*   CSP configs can add extra comments about car features on loading screen;
*   Adjustable wings now can affect several nodes at once (easier to get LODs to work);
*   New `ColoredBlackSpecular` parameter for car paint shader improving look of multi-colored skins, enables automatically with fourth version;
*   Set soil color for tracks along with dirt and grass color;
*   Option to set soil, dirt and grass colors for different types of surfaces;
*   New track inputs: 
    *   `CAR_DAMAGE_N` for amount of damage of Nth car;
    *   `CAR_DAMAGE` for maximum amount of damage of all cars (could be tied to roof lights of ambulances?);
    *   `ONLINE_RACE` switching to 1 for online races;
    *   `TIME_SMOOTH`: time of day in seconds without rounding;
*   In condition expressions, writing `condition:` prefix when referencing a different condition is no longer needed;
*   In places where previously track parameters could either be a number or reference a condition, now expressions are fully supported as well;
*   `CONDITION` for track lights and material adjustments now can use expressions too (although, without color support for now);
*   Issue with parameters `MOVE_MESH_BEHIND` and `MOVE_MESH_IN_FRONT_OF` unable to reorder elements within same parent is fixed;
*   Track configs now can set flame emitters;
*   New `common/particles_track.ini` with some presets for track particles (bonfire, stove, flare);
*   New `common/displays.ini` helping to easily create new quads for digital displays in cars;
*   If you’re using wing animations to show and hide extra bits, now you can configure it so `hidden` geometry would actually be hidden, saving draw calls:
    *   Car lights now can be bound to wing states, referencing wing ID and using LUT for brightness multiplier;
    *   For simple cases with two states where hidden bit is either scaled down or moved far away, CSP should be able to guess things automatically;
    *   Tool to quickly generate such animations with corresponding config is available on CSP wiki;
*   When copying coordinates from Objects Inspector, hold Shift for extra-precision mode;
*   Brakes input for cars fixed, now uses `[BASIC] BRAKES_THRESHOLD` as default threshold;

## For new apps and scripts

*   Python apps:
    *   Live reload for Python apps with Python apps profiler, including fully automated option;
    *   New functions for time control: `ac.ext_getWeatherTimeMult()`, `ac.ext_setWeatherTimeMult(value)`;
    *   New functions for advanced rendering: render to texture, use custom pixel shaders, access virtual mirror texture for custom virtual mirrors;
    *   Function to check if VR is active or not;
    *   Result of `ac.newTexture()` is cached now, feel free to re-create those textures each frame (although it would still be faster to save value locally);
*   WeatherFX:
    *   API to create and manipulate dynamic lights for more advanced visual effects;
    *   New `ac.setSkyV2SunSaturation(number)` to adjust sun saturation;
    *   Functions to adjust VAO and extra AO samples parameters;
    *   New sky-covering clouds using panorama textures as an alternative way to render clouds;
    *   Option to load textures asynchonously, new function to unload textures;
    *   New cloud material parameter `normalFacingExponent` for adjusting normal calculation (default value is 0.5);
    *   New cloud parameter `normalYExponent` for shifting whole cloud shape, to get it to look more as if camera is below;
    *   New cloud parameter `topFogBoost` for boosting fog at the top of the cloud;
*   Scriptable displays:
    *   Script could be in a separate file (`SCRIPT=script.lua`, same as LUTs);
    *   Access mirror texture to create displays with rear view camera and overlays;
    *   Define new cameras (similar to rear view mirror) with optional post-processing and access them in script, for this like parking camera activating with reverse gear;
    *   React to clicks on other meshes (optionally limiting area to certain UV coordinates), so they could act like buttons;
    *   Change car state: switch headlights, high beams and extra toggles;
    *   Control some of car inputs: alter ABS, TC, brake bias or turbo wastegate (could be used to create a dashboard similar to one of BMWs with extra car settings);
    *   New `display.horizontalBar()` function for simple drawing of a progress bar made out of segments;
*   New values for car state for Lua scripts: KERS state, number of gears, number of turbos, H-shifter state and more for user controls and for specific cars.
