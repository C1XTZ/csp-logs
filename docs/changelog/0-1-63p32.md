# Changelog

## New features, options and improvements

*   Non-working wipers fixed (by temporary disabling one of features, but it wasnâ€™t that important; going to investigate why it was breaking wipers);
*   Various stability issues at launch fixed;
*   Windscreen drops fixed (main change, tiny drops are back now);
*   Black raindrops in VR fixed;
*   Broken clipping with Graphics Adjustments in VR fixed;
*   Skinned wipers now supported as well;
*   Rainbow look fixed and improved, now it should be visible with default WeatherFX script (visible always, but that will be improved a bit later, with coming WeatherFX integration).
