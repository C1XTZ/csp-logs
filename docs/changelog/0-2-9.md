# Changelog

## New features, options and improvements

*   New FFB tweak: clean FFB (disables ABS post-processing effect for cars with custom physics, enabled by dfault);
*   VR tweaks: hidden option to shift controllers position and rotation, for better compatibility with edge cases (look for `[CONTROLLERS_INTEGRATION] SHIFT_…` in `vr_tweaks.ini`);
*   Live reload for `gameplay.ini`’s USE_MPH, PIT_INDICATOR/ONLY_IN_PITLINE, GUI/ALLOW_OVERLAPPING_FORMS;
*   CSP logging rewritten to be more efficient, compact and informative;
*   New altered logging experiment:
    *   AC logging is handled by CSP as well;
    *   Also, if enabled, both CSP and AC logging will be done in background, without blocking;
    *   Also, adds a limit to AC log, just in case;
*   New menu:
    *   Session countdown and wait time timers;
    *   Session info updated, new window with server info including CSP tweaks;
    *   Custom popup for a welcome message (unless popup is disabled in chat settings);
    *   Setup items with Y below -2 are hidden;
    *   Support for extra items in Gears tab;
    *   A case where left and right setup items are overlapped is handled better, adjusting labels and hints;
    *   Pressing gas pedal to start the race is working;
    *   `Setup in pits` works properly, mirroring original behavior;
    *   `data_credits.txt` is used for credits;
    *   Few smaller layout fixes and improvements.

## Fixes

*   Checking if ABS is active has been fixed (regression in 0.2.8);
*   `Vanilla` ABS with `TORQUE_MODE_EX=2` is even smoother, just in case;
*   Torque reaction with welded/spool diff cars fixed;
*   Issue with tyres raycasting without extended physics hitting walls above the car is fixed;
*   Modifiers handling improved, fixing compatibility with Steam Deck;
*   Issue with `data_manifest.ini` causing some bindings to not show up at all fixed;
*   Occasional crash during loading with large tracks caused by ODE misconfiguration fixed;
*   `Delay optional stuff` option no longer allows for Grass FX to skip two frames in a row (should fix that disappeared grass report, hopefully);
*   Windscreen FX: `extra reflections for exterior views` option has been fixed;
*   Low beams and high beams flashing online fixed;
*   Rain FX: wet skidmark particles fade faster;
*   Rain FX racing line: drying applies faster on semi-wet surfaces, puddle spreading added in 0.2.8 is a bit more short-lived;
*   Braking torque clamping applies to torque affecting the hub as well, preventing issues with cars using huge handbrake torque and such;
*   New menu, drivers tooltips: support for imperial units (if set in AC settings);
*   The feature of main menu teleporting the player back to pits if race is online and main menu is opened 5 seconds or less before the start now works with new menu or any menu replacement;
*   Wet flags and tents are darker;
*   Stars texture sampling fixed, solving issues with aliasing, performance and weird lines;
*   When DirectX reports HDR as unavailable, CSP now goes and checks HDR setting in Windows as a fallback (turns out, DirectX is not very reliable at all when it comes to this);
*   Walking Out is compatible with Gamepad FX again;
*   Original welcome popup message blocks IMGUI mouse input;
*   OpenRGB integration fixed;

## Configs

*   Excluding meshes from interior masking with `[REFLECTIONS_FX] MASK_CUBEMAP_SKIP=…` fixed;
*   Tyres FX: default value of `FLEX_PROFILE_MULT` changed from 1 to safer 0.8 (it was 0.45 before 0.2.8, but ideally it should’ve been 1), fixing some small clipping issues with some cars;
*   Mask pass with desaturated `smGlass` shader fixed;
*   Case-independent filtering (`<?I>` prefix) is working (how long was it broken for?); this also fixes few CSP defaults: not setting wind for fences and such, even if they use ksGrass/ksTree, using meshes with asphalt and similar in them as defaults for heating mask (as long as shader is ksMultilayer_fresnel_nm), finding out balloon track models, occluding interior refraction in rain drops of the windscreen with displays and LEDs;
*   New `keyword:` property for filtering nodes, meshes and materials: with `keyword:abc+def` any meshes that have `abc` or `def` in names or material names will match (case-independent);
*   Car lights: `RELATIVE_TO` supports CSP filters (`{…}` stuff, still loads a single node though), also CSP now should be able to handle the case where `RELATIVE_TO` node is missing in active LOD;
*   Functions for raycast got an option for backface culling (default, disable or invert);

## Lua

*   `ac.getSim().isVirtualMirrorActive` fixed;
*   New `physics.preventAIFromRetiring()` function to stop AIs from retiring;
*   New fields `ac.getSim().windowSize`, `ac.getUI().useImperialUnits`;
*   New `physics.addTrackSurface()` function for creating new track physics surfaces live (not so good at the moment, lags a lot because of Embree rebuild; old `__tmp_addPhysicsMesh` thing has been removed);
*   A few more new icons;
*   `physics.RigidBody()` moved to an on-demand loading module, docs improved;
*   New `ac.onOpenMainMenu()` for custom main menus to react to `Setup in pits` shortcut and similar things;
*   Scene API: new `:getIndices()` method for meshes.
*   New `ui.itemUnderline()` function;
*   New `ac.exportLapTimesToCSV()` for Lua apps doing the same thing as the `print` button in the original menu;
*   A rare crash with Scene API meshes removal causing animated wipers to crash on reload fixed.
