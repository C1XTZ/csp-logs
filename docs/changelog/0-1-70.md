# Changelog

## New features, options and improvements

*   Improved poisson disc shadows filtering is now applied by default and no longer optional;

*   Racing cars now produce a bit of exhaust smoke no matter the temperature;
*   New settings section with music listering parameters (for navigators and stereos);
*   New UI: CJK symbols are now supported (with a fallback font);

*   If date is not set, original sun trajectory is now used by default;
