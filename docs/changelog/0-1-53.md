# Changelog

## New features, options and improvements

*   FFB tweaks: new range compression option;
*   Fireworks: more holidays, regional holidays (based on track rather than system settings), updated script;
*   Track displays showing image from custom cameras nearby;
*   Skin textures auto-reload for both main car and track (for textures in `skins/default`);
    *   Thing with `.psd` from Custom Showroom also works, but requires installed PSD codec;
*   Refracting headlights looking black for other cars fixed;
*   Real mirrors breaking for few cars like Audi R18 or VRC Formula Lithium 2019 fixed;
*   New CPU optimization for large tracks splitting world into chunks and removing meshes from remote chunks;
*   LOD scaling for tracks in Graphic Adjustments;
*   SSLR: fixed raytracing and adjusted quality levels;
*   Skidmarks and fake shadows work better with SSLR (if surface below is reflective);
*   New Skidmarks FX extension: less even skidmarks with smoother edges, slowly fading away;
*   New `ksTree_ppshadows` shader for geometrical trees (acts a lot like `ksPerPixelAT`, but with wind support and optional dithering A2C);
*   Optional dithering A2C now works for `ksGrass` too;
*   Extended raytracing for tyres (that extended physics feature) misbehaving with camber angles fixed;
*   Extra car animations: new LUT option allowing to add things like pauses between loops;
*   Few extra options for custom emissive;
*   Better moon texture for Weather FX;
*   Wobbling wipers now enabled by default only for Kunos cars;
*   Few smaller fixes and optimizations.
