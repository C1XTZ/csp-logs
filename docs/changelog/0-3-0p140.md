## New features, options and improvements

*   Finally managed to reproduce and solve the bug that I’ve been hunting for quite some time now, with car interiors getting wet in the rain in some cases (turns out, it was only happening on certain mod tracks)
*   Also, disabling chunks optimization shouldn’t mess up some mod tracks now (previous fix wasn’t enough)
