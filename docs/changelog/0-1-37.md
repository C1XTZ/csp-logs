    *   Clouds sorting based on user-set factor;
    *   Clouds covering sun fixed;
    *   Shadows disabling fixed;
    *   Per-cloud fog multiplier;
    *   New functions for WeatherFX implementation:
        1. Sample camera AO;
        2. Set overall brightness;
        3. Adjust sky brightness separately;
        4. Check if bounced light in Extra FX is enabled;
        5. Alternative versions of existing functions to reduce GC load;
