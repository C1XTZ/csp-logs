    *   Loaded best lap time shouldn’t show up in shared memory or in race output;
    *   Ghost recording stops on messed up laps;
    *   Most of these things won’t be available with RSR app present, to be safe (akin to other physical experiments);
    *   Option “Use original materials” loads the skin as well;
    *   Ghost advantage can be loaded live'.

    *   CMAA2 is compatible with VR;
    *   Sun shadows in VR are better configured;
    *   Tweak to display HUD on mirrored window (optionally, hide in the headset, or hide entirely);
    *   OpenVR: a parameter to tweak frame order, might help with responsiveness and performance;
    *   OpenVR: a tweak to submit depth buffer as well (not sure if runtime would do anything with it, but why not give it a try);
    *   Mirroring smoothing works without SPS;
    *   CSP is better aware of moving headset and should handle user leaving the car properly (switch audio and rendering; optional, enabled by default);

    *   Constraining mouse pointer to AC window in VR with windowed mode is enabled by default.

*   Online-related:
    *   Conditions for session voting (for new menu and API) are closer matching original (now can’t cast a session vote in the last 30 seconds of a non-race session);
    *   “Set ballast” confirm button fixed;
    *   Disabling entries in chat settings fixed;
    *   Cheats detection improved a bit;
    *   New `[EXTRA_RULES] NO_BACK_TO_PITS_SESSIONS=Q, R` parameter to forbid teleporting to pits in qualify and race sessions only (“P” for practice);
    *   New `[EXTRA_RULES] DISALLOW_DEV_BUILDS=1` parameter blocking WIP builds, just in case;
    *   CSP syncs server features and background image URL when jumping through a portal;
    *   Custom loading screen script is working even if the server is using a custom loading image.

*   Physics-related:

    *   Experiment fixing spawn points moved to completed section;
    *   Unpausing offline races no longer causes simulation to jump forward in time.

*   Controls:
    *   Raw mouse input rewritten, actually operates at mouse frequency;
    *   New keyboard & mouse script for analog inputs of Wooting keyboards;
    *   Pausing mouse steering resets accumulated angle;
    *   Axis remapping removed from Gamepad FX module, please use Controller Tweaks app instead so it’d be properly stored in “controls.ini”;
    *   Script “Mobile” from Gamepad FX updated, works again (Expo keeps changing things), wizard includes a link to an APK which should work until Google blocks sideloading APKs.

*   Rendering improvements:
    *   Interior masking works a lot better with LCS;
    *   VAO applies to refracting headlights;
    *   Trees in mirrors can receive per-vertex shadows (without using most expensive mirrors option) and react to wind;
    *   Flickering reflections (happening sometimes with a single face per frame and reprojection with LCS) fixed, reflections reprojection is smoother, especially for rougher surfaces;
    *   Shadows flicker around cars in medium distance (noticeable on a race on Nordschleife when starting last, for example) fixed;
    *   Bounce-back effect takes environment brightness into account as well, just a bit, for more lively look;
    *   Puddles got waves if wind is strong enough;
    *   Windscreen shaders flip normals in pixel stage if they detect surfaces facing away from camera (for example, fixes Porsche 911 Carrera S);
    *   Shadows move smoother, especially when sun is close to horizon;
    *   Inverse side of tyres (which started to be drawn around 0.2.6) got an offset, so if a car has tyre meshes double-sided to begin with (for example, Lamborghini Diablo SV by slang_diablo_sv), it wouldn’t look wonky anymore (offset is 2 cm);
    *   Shadows on grass are slightly adjusted to be sharper and more reasonable;
    *   Ideal line no longer illuminates everything with Extra FX;
    *   Light bouncing off track surface shouldn’t illuminate car interiors anymore;
    *   CSP tyre skidmarks no longer have speculars (doesn’t affect ice, dirt or gravel marks).

*   Car audio is entirely rewritten:
    *   Should be faster, better logic when it comes to silencing distant cars;
    *   Car soundbanks can’t redefine events without “/cars/” prefix anymore (but can define the ones that weren’t seen before);
    *   Wind audio is more intense with an opened door;
    *   Limit for cars producing audio at once is set at 25;
    *   Extra parameter “throttle” for turbo event now uses correct throttle value (taking cutting off into account);
    *   CSP exhaust flame particles are linked to backfire audio, audio fixed;
    *   When engine explodes, backfire audio uses a simple DSP to sound a bit differently;
    *   CSP car audio refreshed a bit, useless clutch event is dropped;
    *   New tweak: actual brakes intensity for wheels (affected by ABS);
    *   New tweak: skids audio pauses without slip or contact with ground;
    *   F7 (free) camera no longer gets track camera’s 2.5 volume multiplier for better consistency (not a bug);
    *   Surface audio: volume is tied to the load of the wheels.

*   New window creation and handling:
    *   Exclusive fullscreen has been replaced with a modern compatible fullscreen implementation (just in case, old approach is available as an option);
    *   Alt+Enter is more reliable, with AC keeping its windowed size across sessions;
    *   Maximize button works the same as Alt+Enter;
    *   Binding for Alt+Enter can be changed;
    *   Pressing Alt+Enter if AC window covers most of two monitors will extend it to cover those two (or more) monitors;
    *   Flip model is active everywhere, including VR, unless compatibility option is used;
    *   Cursor clipping (previously used for VR) reworked, now can be activated for windowed mode without VR too;

*   Optimizations:
    *   New option (enabled by default) for using WIC (modern Windows approach to load images) to load PNGs and JPEGs, much faster;
    *   Modern DDS loader tries to generate MIPs on CPU when possible, helps with rendering performance;
    *   Splashscreen shows up faster and takes less time to render;
    *   Loading parallelization is more aggressive;
    *   Custom implementation for audio banks and GUIDs loading to speed things up a bit more;
    *   Shader replacements load textures asynchronously during loading to speed things up and make loading more responsive;
    *   Windscreen reflections optimized a bit, now using lower resolution if blur is active, and a bit simpler blur;
    *   Physics setup for tracks no longer waits for textures to load, speeding up loading a bit;
    *   A lot of functions related to AI splines processing are rewritten to improve accuracy and stability, as well as improve performance (in some cases, some rare overly long tracks might end up being reported as 1% shorter), AC no longer crashes if a spline overlaps itself;
    *   CSP generates lightweight alternative mesh buffers for casting shadows;
    *   IMGUI drawing allocator adjusted, might work a bit faster;
    *   A bunch of other optimizations to loading process;
    *   Mesh and texture deduplication no longer slows down loading or gets in a way of parallelization;

    *   Unused background threads close sooner.

*   DirectX-related tweaks:
    *   During DirectX initialization, CSP keeps track of whatever is going on and shows the culprit in possible slow downs (without that annoying popup message about initialization being slow);
    *   Render scale adjustment is done by CSP now, should resolve some potential issues with variable rate shading and looks better too (quality can be adjusted in Graphics Adjustments);
    *   HDR rendering is compatible with YEBIS replacement;
    *   Compatibility with variable refresh rate improved, no longer optional;
    *   New option “Pace frames better” (disabled by default) helps to reduce latency by asking GPU to time when to start rendering the next frame;
    *   Shaders cache purging on CSP updates no longer clears out cache of other games;
    *   Option to select brand of target GPU in DXGI Tweaks settings;
    *   When GPU asks to slow down (for example, when screen is off), AC will listen;
    *   V-sync video option works with the new swap chain (with an optional tweak for an alternative implementation).

*   More new options:
    *   New non-physics experiment for recording ghost with 1 ms precision (enabled by default);

    *   Aurora effect fixed (there was this annoying shifting of pixels);
    *   Enabled HDR stops YEBIS replacement from dithering and clamping the output;
    *   NaN protection for YEBIS replacement;
    *   If a scriptable filter requires for virtual mirror post-processing to be done separately, YEBIS replacement now can handle the request and add a bit of glare too.

*   New modes:
    *   New Revenant mode: a custom ghost with all the visual effects and proper collisions;
    *   Traffic mode: options can be edited in-game, cars spawn more lively at the start.

    *   Translucent IMGUI windows blur Python apps and AC UI as well;
    *   Blurring for translucent IMGUI windows is better and faster;
    *   Ctrl+Tab works property if UI scale is different from 100%;

    *   New `[ENGINE_DATA] BODY_TORQUE_MULT=0` for “engine.ini” (just in case somebody is working on some silly car where engine is a different thing altogether), sets a multiplier for how much changes in RPM rock the car (use `[ENGINE_DATA] ORIENTATION=0,0,-1` to specify engine orientation);
    *   Inputs `KERS_MAX_KJ` and `KERS_LOAD` now act like `ac.StateCar.kersLoad`, taking both ERS and KERS into account;
    *   If your car is using `transmission_ext` event, add `[AUDIO] TRANSMISSION_EXT_VOLUME_MULT=1` to compute its volume in the same way as AC computes exterior engine volume (boosted for track cameras);

    *   Race config verification updated, AC loads actual track and car IDs when loading a replay;
    *   Benchmark result text includes CSP version;
    *   If FMOD is unable to initialize output device, it’ll automatically try to change to the next one until all possible devices have been tried;

    *   Rare crash related to caching for car physics scripts fixed;
    *   Start camera: overall movement improved a bit, shaking with custom trajectories fixed, support for `"title"` and `"message"` in custom trajectories config is improved;
    *   Mesh optimizations should no longer affect the look of any geometry, also don’t affect meshes on CPU side and only apply when geometry is being transferred to GPU;
    *   If AC ever gets stuck, press Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Win+F12 to crash it and get a report (please send those to me);
    *   Scriptable filters can postpone virtual mirror render via API or in manifest (helps curved filter to be compatible with virtual mirror);

    *   Triple screen configuration saving is a lot more reliable (rewritten, saves automatically a few seconds later, or more reliably on exit);
    *   Skidmarks no longer dent local heightmap (overly complicated, looks messy, and resolution is not quite enough anyway);
    *   “Idle in background” fixed, can be changed live;
    *   Some crash messages are more informative;
    *   Full reloading process reworked a bit: now changes in car or track configs triggering full reload won’t touch unrelated modules (like, adding `[A] B=C` to a car config should no longer force Weather FX to restart);

    *   Shadows from driver hands are no longer a previous animation frame leading to unpleasant artifacts when steering;
    *   Driver model flex no longer overrides car body flex when casting shadows;
    *   Rally and hillclimb tracks, as well as new modes, don’t take into account number of cars when estimating base number of spectators (also, formula is changed so spectators would max out a lot faster);
    *   If Rain FX is disabled, rain in conditions data will always be 0 (fixes issue with rain audio without Rain FX module active);
    *   Rain/dumb AI splines no longer interfere with AIs going to pits;

    *   `mat4x4.look()` no longer crashes if third argument (`up`) is not set;
    *   `rgb:hex()` fixed;
    *   Equality operators for `mat3x3` and `mat4x4`;
    *   `setTimeout`/`setInterval` reworked, more accurate and predictable (callbacks are triggered in order, errored callback doesn’t affect others, timers use the same C++→Lua call to keep things fast);
    *   `string.split`: limit is respected if separator is empty;
    *   CSP string functions can parse math.huge as limit to disable it;
    *   `ac.isControllerGasPressed()` and such respect gamepad axis remapping;
    *   `ac.onOnlineWelcome()` returns message even with the new main menu enabled;
    *   `ac.readDataFile()` fixed, car scripts can load files from “data.acd” without using absolute paths;
    *   Conflict between `ac.getCarColliders()` and `ac.getCarDataFiles()` should be fixed;
    *   List of countries updated and fixed (old entries, such as `ac.NationCode.Turkey`, `ac.NationCode.USA` or `ac.NationCode.Northern`, still work, but are not documented and won’t show up if the list is iterated).

*   I/O:
    *   Numbers in file attributes are proper numbers as well, none of that `uint64` stuff;
    *   File saving (with secure flag) is faster and more reliable;
    *   New `io.setAttributes()`;
    *   New `io.fileInUse()`;
    *   New `io.getExecutableAttributes()`;
    *   New `io.replaceFile()`;
    *   New `io.arePathsEqual()`;
    *   `io.recycle()` actually moves files to the Recycle Bin.

*   UI:
    *   CEF: engine update, fixing a few JS↔Lua communication issues and “ac://” scheme, with a new “acs://” scheme that can be used in secure context (also, disabled paste protection for developer tools), installation and reinstall are more robust;
    *   `ui.columns()` takes flags;
    *   New `ui.bringWindowToBack()`;
    *   `ui.setItemDefaultFocus()` can be used to hint where buttons would move the mouse initially.
    *   Use `ui.forceSimplifiedComposition(true)` to disable frost effect for a single window;
    *   `ui.onExclusiveHUD()`: parameter to get rid of padding, new return values to show Lua Debug app (or other apps) without stopping the rest of UI;
    *   Rounded corners with large radius are smoother;
    *   More mouse cursors are available;
    *   A few new icons.

*   Libraries:
    *   New `shared/ui/components` library for custom main menus to be able to draw chat and other things;
    *   New `shared/utils/kn5` library allowing to collect stuff from KN5 files (such as shader replacements) from background workers too;
    *   New `shared/ui/base` with some generic helpers;
    *   Library `shared/sim/ghost` got a lot more new stuff, overriding ghost time and such works is more reliable;
    *   New functions for `shared/utils/ioext`.

*   Scene API:
    *   `ac.findNodes()` and similar, as well as other scene filters, rewritten to operate much faster;
    *   New `ghostRoot:yes` filter;
    *   New `ac.overrideLODMultiplier()`;
    *   New `ac.findMeshes():hintAsObscured()` method helping chunks optimizer to hide extra geometry (unlike regular deactivation, chunks optimizer removes things from the scene);
    *   `:applySkin()` can take a folder name as well;
    *   `:resetSkin()` works better if it’s a KN5 other than car or track KN5;
    *   `:setVisible()` got a parameter to disable motion reset on re-appearance;
    *   Updating textures with a callback now checks texture size to prevent crashes;
    *   Dynamic textures no longer crash if target materials stop existing;
    *   VAO patch, if present, will be applied when loading extra KN5s (same filename, but with “.vao-patch” extension).

*   Gameplay API:
    *   New `ac.accessMouseDelta()` to access this mouse delta capture, allowing to easily create FPV custom camera controls and such;
    *   New `ac.hideMouseCursor()` to nicely hide mouse for a bit;
    *   New `ac.disableVirtualMirror()`;
    *   New `ac.disableExtraHUDElements()`;
    *   New `ac.disableNeckFXDriverModelMovement()`;
    *   `ac.resetVRPose()` marked as deprecated;
    *   `ac.restartAssettoCorsa()` shouldn’t crash AC anymore (it was working, but leaving its Lua script in a sad state);
    *   `ac.accessAppWindow()` updated, applies UI scale for both AC and IMGUI windows (previously, it was only applied to IMGUI windows);
    *   `ac.trySimKeyPressCommand('Activate AI')` (used by, for example, Unbound app) can be used to disable AI as well;
    *   New `ac.onOutgoingChatMessage()` for intercepting user messages.

*   Physics API:
    *   `physics.setAISpline()` takes an argument for AI hints config file;
    *   `physics.setAITopSpeed()` stops AI flood from setting its AI speed limit;
    *   `physics.setAIPitStopRequest(0, true)` works in the rain;
    *   `physics.addTrackSurface()` fixed, should use the transform matrix properly and be less crashy overall.

*   New Modes:
    *   `ac.setReplayBasedGhost()` to assign a replay of one car as a live state to another car;
    *   `ac.disableCar()` to hide a car entirely;
    *   `[TWEAKS] SAME_DRIVER_MODEL_ACROSS_CARS=1` to use the same driver model for all cars;
    *   `ac.addMainMenuSettings()` adding a custom piece of UI to the main menu;
    *   `physics.setUserControlledCar()` for changing which car is being controlled by user;
    *   New `ac.overrideWeatherConditions()`.

*   Weather FX:
    *   `script.asyncUpdate()` shouldn’t cause any crashes anymore;
    *   New `ac.setCloudShadowBlur()` styles (set to 0 for sharper cloud shadows), can also be used to adjust shadows fade out with distance;
    *   New `ac.overrideVirtualMirrorShader()` for Weather FX styles allowing to set a custom HDR→LDR conversion shader for virtual mirrors and thus move them back to UI layer and solve some potential issues with post-processing (like virtual mirrors messing up sun rays);
    *   Update step (computing controller and style script) moved a bit down the frame, now occurs after the camera position update.

*   Mouse steering:
    *   A few new functions to override keyboard inputs as well (look for “wooting” script).

*   Lua apps:
    *   New `ac.toggleFullscreen()`;
    *   `ac.stringifyCurrentSetup()`: option to exclude metadata;
    *   `ac.getSetupSpinnerValue()` is around 4 times faster;
    *   App services can access `ui.Icons` and `ac.noticeNewApp()`.

*   Car physics scripts:
    *   `ac.addTorque()` got a parameter for FFB (0 by default to keep things compatible);
    *   Car wheels in `ac.accessCarPhysics()` got a `angularVelocity` field for hub angular velocity;
    *   New `ac.setEngineRPMIdle()`;
    *   New values for `ac.overrideSpecificValue()` allowing custom physics scripts to override TC, FFB multiplier and steer assist value.

*   Other changes and fixes:
    *   Scripts stop outputting things in CSP log after 1000 lines, the log includes their names so it’d be easier to track down spammers;
    *   Scripts lifetime management updated, should help with some crashes on reloads;
    *   Scripts with UI/scene access sorted out, from now on all such scripts have full access to scene, UI, render, particles, lights, audio, etc. (apart from car scripts);
    *   When looking for `shared/…` Lua libraries, CSP is going to check its “lua-shared” modules first to speed things up, and fallback to default search only if there isn’t anything (might break compatibility if your script also has “shared/…” folder with the same file names);
    *   Checking if `ui` functions can be used should be more reliable, properly raising an error if used outside of IMGUI context;
    *   Exceptions on C++ side when in Lua API now stop Lua scripts entirely, which hopefully should prevent some of crashes (sadly, it’s the only way to get it to somehow work without sacrificing performance);
    *   Using `ac.overrideWeatherConditions()` or the old function for overriding replay conditions makes sure to restore actual conditions when deactivated even if controller is not pushing new conditions every frame;
    *   Lua Debug app got colorful marks to help distinguish many items (shows up when there are too many, or you can use `ac.debug('name\t#ff0', …)` to specify color explicitly);
    *   Background workers can return values directly using return without losing the first value now (previously, the only way was to use `worker.result = …`);
    *   Scripts loading CSP textures with paths relative to “extension/textures” folder fixed;
    *   LuaJIT panic crashes now should include dumps;
    *   LuaJIT synced with the latest changes upstream;
    *   Some documentation fixes and improvements.
