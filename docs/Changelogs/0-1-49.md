## Changelog

*   Weather FX: option for additional directional ambient;
*   Default Weather FX script:
    *   Sunsets and sun rises fixed, now warmer in color;
    *   Sun light sometimes is less saturated during the day;
    *   Extra layer of lighting for when sun is just below the horizon, with blurry shadows to simulate somewhat directional lighting from the sky;
    *   Cloud textures reworked (requires more work though), increased in variety;
    *   Overall, cloud materials and lighting, especially with moon light, readjusted;
    *   Sky color and brightness readjusted;
    *   Now with its own repo, feel free to use it as a base: [https://github.com/ac-custom-shaders-patch/acc-weatherfx-base](https://web.archive.org/web/20220925154122/https://github.com/ac-custom-shaders-patch/acc-weatherfx-base).
*   Shadows on trees and grass shouldn’t flicker now;
*   Smart Mirror:
    *   Mirrors have correct brightness without it enabled;
    *   Option for mirrors mapping normalization during loading, to fix tilted or stretched reflections (enabled by default);
    *   Option to disable Real Mirrors with virtual mirror;
    *   In case top mirror for Real Mirrors is missing, virtual mirror will show both left and right ones where available;
    *   Simple tilting now disabled by default, settings are rearranged;
*   Custom emissives now can control colors of digital instruments;
*   Dynamic flags improved, with a lot of fixes, new movement, new shader with backlit and optional tessellation;
*   Button for decreasing wipers speed fixed;
*   Tyres audio in Wine is no longer broken;
*   Transparent objects now can cast shadows;
*   Refracting glass:
    *   Raytracing reworked to improve quality and performance;
    *   Sharing of maps between the same car (optionally);
    *   New formula for better color masking (disabled for old setups);
    *   Multi-channel mode without custom bulbs, to use mapping of multi-channel emissives inside;
    *   Flatness with distance fixed by clamping maximum mip level;
    *   Other optimizations and fixes;
*   Bounced light in Extra FX:
    *   Increased distance and resolution (might be a bit heavier);
    *   Improved blurring and fidelity;
    *   Glitch with vertical lines fixed;
    *   No more glow for interiors;
*   New option `[BASIC] IGNORE_OTHER_CONFIGS=0` (default value is 0), for cars to ignore loaded config;

*   New `ac.ext_isVirtualMirrorForced()` Python function;
*   Python apps crashing replay with `ac.getCarRealTimeLeaderboardPosition()` shouldn’t do that anymore;
*   Duplicate shaders removed from archive to save size;
*   Loading screen: new option for slideshow (without any fancy transitions at the moment);
*   PBR shaders: dynamic lights fixed;
*   Support for CM automatically loading vertex AO for cars;
