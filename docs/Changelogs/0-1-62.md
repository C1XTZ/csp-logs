## Changelog

There is no rain in this build yet, still working on. However, there are some other new things:

*   Dynamic shadows;
*   HDR support (requires DXGI flip model and, most likely, adjusted PP-filter);
    *   Now PP-filters can have two sets of tonemapping options, for LDR and HDR modes;
*   GUI:
    *   Option to apply MSAA to original UI (if you have an app drawing aliased shapes, that should help);
    *   New driver tags working in VR and mirrors (show blue and yellow flags);
    *   New simple radar app with focus on performance;
*   Controllers:
    *   New keybinding to shift to neutral gear quickly;
    *   New clutch keybinding for keyboard input method;
    *   Option for order fixing, taking into account instance GUIDs as well (again, update for Content Manager with those is coming);
*   Support for CSP-only servers in Content Manager (update for it is coming soon);
*   Regular sun shadows optimized a bit:
    *   New faster rendering traversal;
    *   No cars in third split;
    *   Single draw call for remote cars using mesh from LOD D (with fallback to collider mesh if there is no LOD D);
*   Smart Mirror: optional subtle shaking for older cars on high speeds;
*   Smooth particles work in VR and triple screen with and without MSAA (but post-processing is still required);
*   New simpler refraction for new glass shader, works in single, VR and triple screen (post-processing is required), good for flat or too bumpy glass, much easier to set;
*   Fake Shadows FX: taking dynamic lights into account (good with dynamic shadows), plus additional fix for neon lights not working properly because of fake shadows;
*   Weather FX:
    *   Option for sharper higher quality stars (sharpening and altered sampling);
    *   Option for increased clouds fidelity;
    *   Option for mirage-like reflections for especially hot conditions;
*   Extra FX:
    *   Motion blur is applied after TAA;
    *   Fog blur is applied after TAA, but before motion blur;
    *   New heat distortion option for fog blur (combined with mirage-like reflections from Weather FX, both take fast moving cars into account);
    *   Some optimizations;
*   Wiper modes reworked: from three modes on modern cars (intermittent, slow and fast) to just a single mode on very old cars, possible to redefine;
*   Wipers sync online;
*   New FFB tweak for more accurate calculation of FFB with MacPherson struct suspension by Stereo (applied to a few rare cars with a certain unusual configuration, wouldn’t affect Kunos cars);
*   New photo app option forcing flames on;
*   Broken glass shader reworked, now with a bit of refraction and custom parameters;
*   Optimized draw order and caching generated grids and payloads are now enabled by default, and default lights brightness changed to 100%;
*   New small tweak to hide driver model completely in first person view in VR, for cars with H-shifter (but still show it in rear view mirrors);
*   Support for Spotify desktop player for navigators (and new car stereo thing, check out Abarth 500).

## Fixes

*   Extended physics sometimes physics thread to misbehave and crash to brown/pink screen fixed;
*   Live reload for extended physics causing all sorts of crashes or not applying any changes should be fixed;
*   Chunks optimization works now properly (before, it was always disabled);
*   Tyres FX: custom textures work in mirrors now;
*   Fake Shadows FX: issue with fog backlit fixed;
*   Windscreen FX raindrops (old ones) now shouldn’t these jumps when wiper state changes;
*   VHS filter works on screenshots, also, font is now shipped with CSP;
*   Nice Screenshots now shouldn’t use rotation for vertical aspect ratios with incompatible effects, plus an option to turn off rotation completely;
*   Sparks online disabled for now, need more testing;
*   Lights handling reworked to speed things up on tracks with thousands of those and fix that issue with them slowly coming on as camera jumps a long distance;
*   Now up to 12 cars can have their headlights mirrored instead in replays and such, instead of 4 as before (that looked horrible);
*   Analog clocks on tracks fixed;
*   New chat app: symbols from Latin Extended sets and Currency sets are supported, failed login should allow to try again, color changing should allow to cancel;
*   Track volumetric lights now can be wider, but that would make them shorter;
*   Orbit (F5) camera wouldn’t get out of focus now unless that new photo mode app is active;
*   Messed up glass backlit fixed;
*   Sky artifacts with somewhat extreme settings fixed;
*   Ground occlusion for tyres fixed;
*   Refracting headlights in rear view mirror fixed;
*   Weather FX: default script doesn’t mess up sun rays anymore;
*   A few smaller fixes and optimizations.

## For new content and configs

*   New fur material for car interiors (might be a bit too expensive to use too often);
*   New car stereo thing for cars, showing current artist and track and source icon, or time, or some simple animation;
*   New properies to filter nodes, meshes and materials by (for making cars and track configs);
*   New `MOVE_MESH_IN_FRONT_OF` option for `[SHADER_REPLACEMENT_…]`;
*   New `FADE_FAKE_SHADOW` option for car lights: set it to something like 0.8 for neon lights to reduce opacity of fake shadows when lights are on;
*   New `[SMOOTH_NORMALS_…]` adjustment for smoothing out normals of certain meshes (great for some Kunos tracks);
*   New bending shader for cars, with optional tessellation, used for:
    *   Wipers bending to follow curvature of windscreen and reduce gaps: `[BENDING_WIPER_…]`;
    *   Side nets (next to side windows on some racing cars) shaking: `[SIDE_NET_…]`; can be used for antennas and such as well;
    *   Shaking exhausts without any nodes rearrangement: `[SHAKING_EXHAUST_…]`;
    *   Wobbly meshes similar to wobbly bits, but without the need for skinning: `[WOBBLY_MESH_…]`;
    *   Please note: whole thing is pretty primitive, simply adding certain offset based on closeness to certain areas, without any rotation;
*   New conditioned animator for tracks, moving, rotating and scaling based on conditions;
*   Track displays: option to use actual track cameras, option to use Office-style placeholder;
*   Object inspector: local and in-car coordinates, scene nodes tree;
*   Colorful vertex AO is no longer supported, converted to regular one during loading;
*   Set custom wiper modes for cars: specify speed and delay between runs;
*   New Python functions to select a mode or check number of modes (old functions still work as well);
*   New wiper-related car inputs: `WIPERS_MODE` and `WIPERS_PROGRESS` (for animation progress);
*   New car inputs for turn signal without hazards: `TURNSIGNAL_NOHAZARD_LEFT`, `TURNSIGNAL_NOHAZARD_RIGHT`, `TURNSIGNAL_NOHAZARD`;
*   Adjust intensity of Extra FX bounced light in track config;
*   New `DISABLE_WITH_BOUNCED_LIGHT` option for track lights: please use it if you set light to act like fake ambient lighting;
*   New `EXTRA_FX/DELAYED_RENDER_INTERIOR` option for cars, to list meshes which should only be rendered after Extra FX in first person view;
*   Now `INCLUDE_IN_CUBEMAP` option of `[SHADER_REPLACEMENT_…]` wouldn’t mess with world detail level;
*   Shader `ksMultilayer_fresnel_nm` uses tiling fix and anisotropic filtration for its normal map now;
*   Occlusion behaviour for PBR shaders adjusted to work better with new OptiX bakery with bouncing light;
*   Grass FX: smoother mask for custom texture separating colored and non-colored areas;
*   Set list of heating areas for heat distortion and mirage effect with `[HEATING_SURFACES] MESHES = …` and `MATERIALS = …` (or CSP would try to guess);
*   New extended physics addition, speed limiter (fixed and static, meant for trucks racing).
