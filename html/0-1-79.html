<li>ExtraFX update:
<ul>
<li>SSLR: various fixes and tweaks, lower resolution tracing improved, new quality levels including Hi-Z tracing (expensive, but produces best results);</li>
<li>SSAO (poor implementation) removed until further improvement;</li>
<li>SSGI removed for good;</li>
<li>Instead, added a new view-independent effect for cars to reflect intense light on the ground around them;</li>
<li>Emissive meshes can cast light on surrounding geometry (currently needs a car or track config);</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Brake Disc FX:
<ul>
<li>Rim silhouette is used for more accurate reflection and occlusion;</li>
<li>Few fixes to improve compatibility with various cars;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>New system for adding hundreds of thousands of trees and smaller bushes to tracks:
<ul>
<li>So far it’s not procedural and requires track creators to provide tree models in a new format (docs are coming soon);</li>
<li>Trees can be 3D or billboards;</li>
<li>With heavy use of instancing and other optimization techniques tens or hundreds of trees can be added without an issue;</li>
<li>VAO integration is fully supported: new trees both cast shadows and receive ambient shadows from scene and other trees;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Original AC heat shimmer updated (optional):
<ul>
<li>Taking into account wind and temperature;</li>
<li>Spawning more with flames and overheated brakes;</li>
<li>Configurable per car;</li>
<li>Tracks can add similar effect to bonfires and such (already included in “particles_track.ini”);</li>
</ul></li>
<li>New AI behaviour: optional rubberbanding (makes cars in front of you slower and cars behind faster);</li>
<li>Scenery lighting hack for old shaders: now sunsets should keep the track brighter, with more PBR-like look (set by WeatherFX script);</li>
<li>Reflections in car rims are occluded using shadowed wheels module; </li>
<li>Default weather: improved lighting, adjustments for fog;</li>
<li>Option to stop Escape button from exiting replays;</li>
<li>Experimental option to improve loading speed;</li>
<li>Improved shaders loading (should reduce microstutters);</li>
<li>New controls button for pausing the race compatible with steering wheels and gamepads (uses Start button by default if nothing else has been selected);</li>
<li>PS5 DualSense support (light bar, LEDs, pad, new API for Gamepad FX allowing to access acceleration, gyroscope and apply resistance to triggers);</li>
<li>Control Tweaks app can change gamepad buttons live (useful with DualSense controllers);</li>
<li>Car Mirrors Configurator app now allows for a more precise adjustment;</li>
<li>New CSP apps now store their position and size across different desktops;</li>
<li>Real Mirrors: “VR lock” option is compatible with “Alter FOV” now;</li>
<li>Option for adding MIPs to rear view mirrors to reduce aliasing (enabled by default);</li>
<li>Small Tweaks: option to turn driver head with free and orbit cameras;</li>
<li>Some protection from cheating online;</li>
<li>Improved errors handling.</li>
</ul>
