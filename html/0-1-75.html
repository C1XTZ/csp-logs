<ul>
<li>Human surface material now can be set in car config;</li>
<li>GrassFX: option to adjust texture brightness in track config (for colored parts);
<ul>
<li>Variations of Highlands textures are removed to save space, instead for compatibility CSP will use a brightness adjustment for them;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Apps for track conditions and track occluders are removed;</li>

<li>New addition for cars, <code>[EXTRA_SHAPE_...]</code> allowing to create new geometry (for example, for Kunos cars missing some indicators or properly mapped displays);</li>
<li>New templates for easy creation of new displays and indicators with [EXTRA<em>SHAPE</em>...];</li>
<li>New <code>RESOLUTION_LIMIT</code> option for dynamic textures, to make sure unusually set scaling wouldn’t make them too big;</li>

</ul></li>

<li>Parameter to clip out everything outside of 0…1 texture coordinates;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hex colors in material adjustments now work;</li>

</ul></li>
<li>New modes:
<ul>
<li>API to draw UI moved from <code>ac.ui…</code> to <code>ui.…</code> (sorry about this, I usually try not to break compatibility, but it’s just been released and I think it’s better to fix this one sooner);</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Automatically generated definitions now include types.</li>
