<li>Also, for Oculus: CSP now updates AC manifest, updates assets to show details about the race, closes AC if itsd VR element is closed;</li>
<li>Better OpenComposite (previously known as OpenOVR) support, for both OpenCompositeACC and regular OpenComposite version (fixing crash with “ipdOffset”);</li>
<li>Crashes in VR now shut down AC first and show errors in a separate process, to make sure VR environment would switch back to desktop;</li>
<li>X-ray rendering for HUD to stop things looking weird if there is some geometry in front of HUD;</li>
<li>Controllers integration: interact with HUD, adjust rear view mirrors, use touchscreens, press car buttons and more (if car has those set);</li>
<li>Experimental option to get driver hands to follow VR controllers;</li>
