#### Changelog:

*   New server options:
    *   New method to calculate wheel positions for remote cars, should be somewhat better if remote car has jumped or flipped (optional);
    *   Also with that new method, server can optionally let clients exchange data on toe and camber for more accurate wheels positioning;
    *   And also, new method might reduce CPU load for clients;
    *   Make disconnected cars visible;
    *   Adjust amount of those spectating 2D people in stands;
    *   Limit controls lock time;
    *   Force headlights for all cars without making server CSP-only;
    *   Stop some pitlanes from counting towards serving drivethrough penalty (for example, secondary pitlane on Spa);
    *   Configure collisions between cars (make them softer, stiffer, bouncier, etc.; depends on what the server might need);
    *   Enable lap invalidation for laps with car going through pits;
    *   Verify integrity of miscellaneous Assetto Corsa files;
    *   Force specific CSP modules to be active;
    *   To extended previously added `NO_BACK_TO_PITS`: now possible to allow to use pits for cars that are already in their pit position (for accessing setups);
