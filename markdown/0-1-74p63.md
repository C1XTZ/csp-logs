*   Tags: untested
*   Size: ??.?? MB

#### Changelog:

*   New generic configs affecting all cars and tracks (wouldn’t do much at the moment);
*   Major rewrite of advanced culling to improve its performance;
*   DXGI tweaks got a few more options (unrelated to flip model):
    *   Use GPU based on selected screen in AC video settings;
    *   True borderless mode;
    *   Triple buffering and custom maximum frame latency;
*   Option for SIMD-accelerated culling for tracks;
*   Option to disable audio if AC is minimized or in background;
*   Smart mirror: option to override mirrors rendering distance;
*   Radar app: settings for colors, updated look;
*   Loading smoothness and informativeness greatly improved, thanks to new built-in loading profiler;
*   Loading should be faster now, with option to speed it up further with caching (enabled by default);
*   VAO darkness fixed with dynamically adjustable gamma;
*   Reworked crash messages, now with additional checks and tips;
*   Crash reports include CSP settings preset;
*   Sound speed takes temperature and other stuff into account;
*   GUI: optional warning for throttle and brake pedals overlap;
*   Custom colors online now saved across sessions;
*   Option for adaptive near clip plane to improve the look with camera far away from cars and track;
*   Custom VR mirroring: new mode showing right eye only;
*   Teleporting destinations list is more compact, supports grouping and can filter points;
*   Few small optimizations.

#### Fixes:

*   Crashes on certain tracks fixed;
*   Option for smoother loading shouldn’t make it that much longer now;
*   “Show on screen” now works properly, including negative coordinates or fullscreen;
*   Non-mirrory mirrors on other cars fixed;
*   Reflection cubemap messing up rendering order and causing some meshes to not be visible fixed;
*   Pinned app are no longer resizable;
*   Changed general settings during the race now won’t trigger full CSP reload;
*   WeatherFX: cloud shadows and cloud rendering fixed;
*   Navigators occasionally showing random mess on map fixed, also now work without GUI module enabled;
*   Major performance issue appearing on some GPUs as a strange FPS limiter fixed;
*   Crashes with car instruments module disabled fixed;
*   Heating effect not working properly without bounced light enabled fixed;
*   Meshes on distant cars disappearing too early fixed;
*   TyresFX now works in mirrors properly;
*   PBR shader with clear coat: dynamic lights fixed;
*   Exterior glancing head trajectory fixed to avoid clipping through the roof in some cars;
*   Accessible color now uses 32 bpp instead of 64 to help with performance;
*   Forced throttle and neutral gear button for keyboard input mode fixed;
*   Fireworks audio and visual fixed, now reflected in cubemaps;
*   Crash with mouse steering on certain tracks with very short AI spline fixed;
*   Mirrors breaking and cockit switching to LR version with F6 cameras when other cars are close fixed;
*   TyresFX no longer breaks after session restart;
*   Inverted reflections (for example, causing black blobs on some tyres at night) fixed;
*   Few smaller fixes.

#### For new content and configs:

*   TyresFX: specify tyres pattern for certain tyre types in config;
*   Extended physics for cars: 
    *   Option to use real mass online to improve collisions for heavy cars;
    *   Options to redefine collision parameters;
*   Extended physics for tracks: 
    *   Option to use real mass for cars online;
    *   Options to redefine collision parameters for different surfaces;
    *   Option to use rigid collision between surface and car mesh colliders, to try and prevent cars falling through in some extreme cases;
*   INIpp: includes now can be optional, with expressions for file names, new functions to access and modify stuff that’s already been parsed;
*   New inputs for `read()` for car and track configs;
*   WeatherFX: new `ac.setVAOExponent(gamma)` function;
*   Python function `ac.ext_loadIniFileAsJson()` fixed, `ac.ext_parseIniFileToJson()` renamed to `ac.ext_parseIniAsJson()` (old name also works for compatibility);
*   New parameter `SHOW_IN_REFLECTIONS` for track lights (please use it carefully, by default only lights with range above 10 meters is included to speed things up);
*   Car lights: tint for high and low beams;
*   Car lights and custom emissives: separate lag up/down, custom heating color and other parameters;
*   Setting `set observeDigital 1` shouldn’t crash AC now;
*   New Lua function `ac.getSoundSpeedMs()` to get accurate sound speed;
*   Lua audio events got a new pitch parameter;
*   Extended raytracing for advanced tyre collision detection uses fewer samples to speed things up;
*   Photoelastic PBR glass now supports multi-emissives as well.
